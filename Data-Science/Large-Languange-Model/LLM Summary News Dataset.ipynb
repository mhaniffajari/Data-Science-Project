There will be a war with North Korea over the missile program if they continue to try to hit America with an ICBM,? he said, describing his discussions with Trump.?He?s told me that. I believe him. If I were China, I would believe him, too, and do something about it. You can stop North Korea, militarily or diplomatically.?I prefer the diplomatic approach. But they will not be allowed to have a missile to hit America with a nuclear weapon on top.? \n",

      "Opposition Congress said in Rajya Sabha on Monday that its MP Raj Babbar was allegedly injured in police action against villagers protesting demolition of their houses in the Ambedkar Nagar district of Uttar Pradesh.Raising the issue through a notice under rule 267 that seeks setting aside of the business to take up discussion on the issue, Pramod Tiwari (Cong) said force was used against the villagers protesting against demolition.Raj Babbar, he said, was injured and is unable to attend the proceedings in Parliament.Deputy chairman PJ Kurien said if the member has a complaint, he can raise it and give a privilege notice.Tiwari was joined by other Congress members in raising the issue of the safety and security of Babbar, who is sitting on dharna at the protest site.Kurien asked them if the lawmaker was being prevented from attending Parliament. When they replied in negative, he said the notice is not admitted.Finance minister and Leader of the House Arun Jaitley said Babbar cannot be present at both the places - the dharna site and Parliament at the same time and he has to decide where he wants to be.Kurien said if Babbar is sitting on a dharna, it is for the state government to deal with it.Sharad Yadav (JD-U) raised the issue of employees of Jabalpur ordnance factory being on protest against the closure of certain units there.He said there were 41 ordnance factories in the country, manufacturing some 600 items for defence.The government should take note of the protests against the closure of the vehicle manufacturing factory, he said.Kurien however disallowed the notice.  \n",

Police said they have arrested one of the accused, a juvenile, while the other is on the run. The incident, reported from a village in Sonepat?s Kharkhoda block, comes close on the heels of a series of similar incidents being reported from the state in the last two months. The police said the girl was taken to a hospital by her family on July 29 after she complained of stomach ache. The victim then narrated her ordeal to her mother. She said she was first raped by her cousins in December last year when they barged into her house when she was alone. The accused allegedly continued to rape her, threatening to kill her parents if she informed anyone.The girl, a school dropout, did not inform anyone out of fear. The police have registered a case under the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and other sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against the two. Kharkhoda station house officer (SHO) Pradeep Singh said the arrested boy was produced in court which sent him to juvenile home. Doctors at the Rohtak civil hospital have ruled out abortion at this stage, maintaining that it could be life-threatening to the minor girl. The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act in India allows abortion up to 20 weeks of pregnancy.\n",

Every district is our asset. People from every religion, caste will be here.?This is India. It is our duty to protect it, not to divide it. I love the hills like all other districts of West Bengal. But people must remember that the hills are a part of West Bengal and will remain so in the future,? she said in a rally here in North Dinajpur district this afternoon.?Whatever happens, everyone should remember that I am ready to give up my life but I will never support dividing (the state) into parts. Every district is our asset. People from every religion, caste will be here,? said Banerjee.The chief minister said that she would do everything for the development of Darjeeling but not anything which may lead to a riot or create disturbance among the people.Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) is spearheading the shutdown in Darjeeling to press the demand for a separate Gorkhaland.She requested political parties and leaders in the hills, to ?be calm and help in restoring normal life in Darjeeling?, to bring back peace and solve problems being faced by the locals.?I want the hills to get back to normal life. I want the tea gardens to start their operations. Darjeeling tea is a global brand, do not spoil it,? Banerjee said.The chief minister said that a political movement should be for the welfare of the people but the ongoing one by the GJM is ?only for the sake of politics?.?Today tea garden workers are not getting food. Students are unable to go to their schools and colleges. Tourism is getting affected. Why are you (GJM) in such a movement? There is no fault of the common people. They have not done anything wrong.?People are troubled and you (GJM) are continuing with the movement only for the sake of politics. This is not right,? she said.Banerjee alleged that it was not the hill people who were creating trouble, but political leaders, who were bringing in goons from outside to create law and order problems there.GJM chief Bimal Gurung had yesterday asked the chief minister to ?come and see the sad situation? in the hills.She had last visited Darjeeling on June 8, when the GJM supporters had clashed with the police outside the Rajbhavan where the state cabinet meeting was held. Following this, an agitation started and subsequently call for an indefinite strike was given in support of their demand of separate Gorkhaland.\n",

      "Opposition Congress said in Rajya Sabha on Monday that its MP Raj Babbar was allegedly injured in police action against villagers protesting demolition of their houses in the Ambedkar Nagar district of Uttar Pradesh.Raising the issue through a notice under rule 267 that seeks setting aside of the business to take up discussion on the issue, Pramod Tiwari (Cong) said force was used against the villagers protesting against demolition.Raj Babbar, he said, was injured and is unable to attend the proceedings in Parliament.Deputy chairman PJ Kurien said if the member has a complaint, he can raise it and give a privilege notice.Tiwari was joined by other Congress members in raising the issue of the safety and security of Babbar, who is sitting on dharna at the protest site.Kurien asked them if the lawmaker was being prevented from attending Parliament. When they replied in negative, he said the notice is not admitted.Finance minister and Leader of the House Arun Jaitley said Babbar cannot be present at both the places - the dharna site and Parliament at the same time and he has to decide where he wants to be.Kurien said if Babbar is sitting on a dharna, it is for the state government to deal with it.Sharad Yadav (JD-U) raised the issue of employees of Jabalpur ordnance factory being on protest against the closure of certain units there.He said there were 41 ordnance factories in the country, manufacturing some 600 items for defence.The government should take note of the protests against the closure of the vehicle manufacturing factory, he said.Kurien however disallowed the notice.  \n",
