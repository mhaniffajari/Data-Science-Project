       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'Data\\\\plato_speech.txt'}, page_content='Concerning the things about which you ask to be informed I believe that I am not ill-prepared with an answer. For the day before yesterday I was coming from my own home at Phalerum to the city, and one of my acquaintance, who had caught a sight of me from behind, hind, out playfully in the distance, said: Apollodorus, O thou Phalerian man, halt! So I did as I was bid; and then he said, I was looking for you, Apollodorus, only just now, that I might ask you about the speeches in praise of love, which were delivered by Socrates, Alcibiades, and others, at Agathon\\'s supper. Phoenix, the son of Philip, told another person who told me of them; his narrative was very indistinct, but he said that you knew, and I wish that you would give me an account of them. Who, if not you, should be the reporter of the words of your friend? And first tell me, he said, were you present at this meeting?\\n\\nYour informant, Glaucon, I said, must have been very indistinct indeed, if you imagine that the occasion was recent; or that I could have been of the party.\\n\\nWhy, yes, he replied, I thought so.\\n\\nImpossible: I said. Are you ignorant that for many years Agathon has not resided at Athens; and not three have elapsed since I became acquainted with Socrates, and have made it my daily business to know all that he says and does. There was a time when I was running about the world, fancying myself to be well employed, but I was really a most wretched thing, no better than you are now. I thought that I ought to do anything rather than be a philosopher.\\n\\nWell, he said, jesting apart, tell me when the meeting occurred.\\nIn our boyhood, I replied, when Agathon won the prize with his first tragedy, on the day after that on which he and his chorus offered the sacrifice of victory.\\n\\nThen it must have been a long while ago, he said; and who told you-did Socrates?\\n\\nNo indeed, I replied, but the same person who told Phoenix;-he was a little fellow, who never wore any shoes Aristodemus, of the deme of Cydathenaeum. He had been at Agathon\\'s feast; and I think that in those days there was no one who was a more devoted admirer of Socrates. Moreover, I have asked Socrates about the truth of some parts of his narrative, and he confirmed them. Then, said Glaucon, let us have the tale over again; is not the road to Athens just made for conversation? And so we walked, and talked of the discourses on love; and therefore, as I said at first, I am not ill-prepared to comply with your request, and will have another rehearsal of them if you like. For to speak or to hear others speak of philosophy always gives me the greatest pleasure, to say nothing of the profit. But when I hear another strain, especially that of you rich men and traders, such conversation displeases me; and I pity you who are my companions, because you think that you are doing something when in reality you are doing nothing. And I dare say that you pity me in return, whom you regard as an unhappy creature, and very probably you are right. But I certainly know of you what you only think of me-there is the difference.\\n\\nCompanion. I see, Apollodorus, that you are just the same-always speaking evil of yourself, and of others; and I do believe that you pity all mankind, with the exception of Socrates, yourself first of all, true in this to your old name, which, however deserved I know how you acquired, of Apollodorus the madman; for you are always raging against yourself and everybody but Socrates.\\n\\nApollodorus. Yes, friend, and the reason why I am said to be mad, and out of my wits, is just because I have these notions of myself and you; no other evidence is required.\\n\\nCom. No more of that, Apollodorus; but let me renew my request that you would repeat the conversation.\\n\\nApoll. Well, the tale of love was on this wise:-But perhaps I had better begin at the beginning, and endeavour to give you the exact words of Aristodemus:\\n\\nHe said that he met Socrates fresh from the bath and sandalled; and as the sight of the sandals was unusual, he asked him whither he was going that he had been converted into such a beau:-\\n\\nTo a banquet at Agathon\\'s, he replied, whose invitation to his sacrifice of victory I refused yesterday, fearing a crowd, but promising that I would come to-day instead; and so I have put on my finery, because he is such a fine man. What say you to going with me unasked?\\n\\nI will do as you bid me, I replied.\\nFollow then, he said, and let us demolish the proverb:\\n\\nTo the feasts of inferior men the good unbidden go; instead of which our proverb will run:-\\n\\nTo the feasts of the good the good unbidden go; and this alteration may be supported by the authority of Homer himself, who not only demolishes but literally outrages the proverb. For, after picturing Agamemnon as the most valiant of men, he makes Menelaus, who is but a fainthearted warrior, come unbidden to the banquet of Agamemnon, who is feasting and offering sacrifices, not the better to the worse, but the worse to the better.\\n\\nI rather fear, Socrates, said Aristodemus, lest this may still be my case; and that, like Menelaus in Homer, I shall be the inferior person, who\\n\\nTo the leasts of the wise unbidden goes. But I shall say that I was bidden of you, and then you will have to make an excuse.\\n\\nTwo going together, he replied, in Homeric fashion, one or other of them may invent an excuse by the way.\\n\\nThis was the style of their conversation as they went along. Socrates dropped behind in a fit of abstraction, and desired Aristodemus, who was waiting, to go on before him. When he reached the house of Agathon he found the doors wide open, and a comical thing happened. A servant coming out met him, and led him at once into the banqueting-hall in which the guests were reclining, for the banquet was about to begin. Welcome, Aristodemus, said Agathon, as soon as he appeared-you are just in time to sup with us; if you come on any other matter put it off, and make one of us, as I was looking for you yesterday and meant to have asked you, if I could have found you. But what have you done with Socrates?\\n\\nI turned round, but Socrates was nowhere to be seen; and I had to explain that he had been with me a moment before, and that I came by his invitation to the supper.\\n\\nYou were quite right in coming, said Agathon; but where is he himself?\\n\\nHe was behind me just now, as I entered, he said, and I cannot think what has become of him.\\n\\nGo and look for him, boy, said Agathon, and bring him in; and do you, Aristodemus, meanwhile take the place by Eryximachus.\\n\\nThe servant then assisted him to wash, and he lay down, and presently another servant came in and reported that our friend Socrates had retired into the portico of the neighbouring house. \"There he is fixed,\" said he, \"and when I call to him he will not stir.\"\\n\\nHow strange, said Agathon; then you must call him again, and keep calling him.\\n\\nLet him alone, said my informant; he has a way of stopping anywhere and losing himself without any reason. I believe that he will soon appear; do not therefore disturb him.\\n\\nWell, if you think so, I will leave him, said Agathon. And then, turning to the servants, he added, \"Let us have supper without waiting for him. Serve up whatever you please, for there; is no one to give you orders; hitherto I have never left you to yourselves. But on this occasion imagine that you art our hosts, and that I and the company are your guests; treat us well, and then we shall commend you.\" After this, supper was served, but still no-Socrates; and during the meal Agathon several times expressed a wish to send for him, but Aristodemus objected; and at last when the feast was about half over-for the fit, as usual, was not of long duration-Socrates entered; Agathon, who was reclining alone at the end of the table, begged that he would take the place next to him; that \"I may touch you,\" he said, \"and have the benefit of that wise thought which came into your mind in the portico, and is now in your possession; for I am certain that you would not have come away until you had found what you sought.\"\\n\\nHow I wish, said Socrates, taking his place as he was desired, that wisdom could be infused by touch, out of the fuller the emptier man, as water runs through wool out of a fuller cup into an emptier one; if that were so, how greatly should I value the privilege of reclining at your side! For you would have filled me full with a stream of wisdom plenteous and fair; whereas my own is of a very mean and questionable sort, no better than a dream. But yours is bright and full of promise, and was manifested forth in all the splendour of youth the day before yesterday, in the presence of more than thirty thousand Hellenes.\\n\\nYou are mocking, Socrates, said Agathon, and ere long you and I will have to determine who bears off the palm of wisdom-of this Dionysus shall be the judge; but at present you are better occupied with supper.\\n\\nSocrates took his place on the couch, and supped with the rest; and then libations were offered, and after a hymn had been sung to the god, and there had been the usual ceremonies, they were about to commence drinking, when Pausanias said, And now, my friends, how can we drink with least injury to ourselves? I can assure you that I feel severely the effect of yesterday\\'s potations, and must have time to recover; and I suspect that most of you are in the same predicament, for you were of the party yesterday. Consider then: How can the drinking be made easiest?\\n\\nI entirely agree, said Aristophanes, that we should, by all means, avoid hard drinking, for I was myself one of those who were yesterday drowned in drink.\\n\\nI think that you are right, said Eryximachus, the son of Acumenus; but I should still like to hear one other person speak: Is Agathon able to drink hard?\\n\\nI am not equal to it, said Agathon.\\nThen, the Eryximachus, the weak heads like myself, Aristodemus, Phaedrus, and others who never can drink, are fortunate in finding that the stronger ones are not in a drinking mood. (I do not include Socrates, who is able either to drink or to abstain, and will not mind, whichever we do.) Well, as of none of the company seem disposed to drink much, I may be forgiven for saying, as a physician, that drinking deep is a bad practice, which I never follow, if I can help, and certainly do not recommend to another, least of all to any one who still feels the effects of yesterday\\'s carouse.\\n\\nI always do what you advise, and especially what you prescribe as a physician, rejoined Phaedrus the Myrrhinusian, and the rest of the company, if they are wise, will do the same.\\n\\nIt was agreed that drinking was not to be the order of the day, but that they were all to drink only so much as they pleased.\\n\\nThen, said Eryximachus, as you are all agreed that drinking is to be voluntary, and that there is to be no compulsion, I move, in the next place, that the flute-girl, who has just made her appearance, be told to go away and play to herself, or, if she likes, to the women who are within. To-day let us have conversation instead; and, if you will allow me, I will tell you what sort of conversation. This proposal having been accepted, Eryximachus proceeded as follows:-\\n\\nI will begin, he said, after the manner of Melanippe in Euripides,\\n\\nNot mine the word which I am about to speak, but that of Phaedrus. For often he says to me in an indignant tone: \"What a strange thing it is, Eryximachus, that, whereas other gods have poems and hymns made in their honour, the great and glorious god, Love, has no encomiast among all the poets who are so many. There are the worthy sophists too-the excellent Prodicus for example, who have descanted in prose on the virtues of Heracles and other heroes; and, what is still more extraordinary, I have met with a philosophical work in which the utility of salt has been made the theme of an eloquent discourse; and many other like things have had a like honour bestowed upon them. And only to think that there should have been an eager interest created about them, and yet that to this day no one has ever dared worthily to hymn Love\\'s praises! So entirely has this great deity been neglected.\" Now in this Phaedrus seems to me to be quite right, and therefore I want to offer him a contribution; also I think that at the present moment we who are here assembled cannot do better than honour the. god Love. If you agree with me, there will be no lack of conversation; for I mean to propose that each of us in turn, going from left to right, shall make a speech in honour of Love. Let him give us the best which he can; and Phaedrus, because he is sitting first on the left hand, and because he is the father of the thought, shall begin.\\n\\nNo one will vote against you, Eryximachus, said Socrates. How can I oppose your motion, who profess to understand nothing but matters of love; nor, I presume, will Agathon and Pausanias; and there can be no doubt of Aristophanes, whose whole concern is with Dionysus and Aphrodite; nor will any one disagree of those whom I, see around me. The proposal, as I am aware, may seem rather hard upon us whose place is last; but we shall be contented if we hear some good speeches first. Let Phaedrus begin the praise of Love, and good luck to him. All the company expressed their assent, and desired him to do as Socrates bade him.\\n\\nAristodemus did not recollect all that was said, nor do I recollect all that he related to me; but I will tell you what I thought most worthy of remembrance, and what the chief speakers said.\\n\\nPhaedrus began by affirming that love is a mighty god, and wonderful among gods and men, but especially wonderful in his birth. For he is the eldest of the gods, which is an honour to him; and a proof of his claim to this honour is, that of his parents there is no memorial; neither poet nor prose-writer has ever affirmed that he had any. As Hesiod says:\\n\\nFirst Chaos came, and then broad-bosomed Earth,\\nThe everlasting seat of all that is,\\nAnd Love. In other words, after Chaos, the Earth and Love, these two, came into being. Also Parmenides sings of Generation:\\n\\nFirst in the train of gods, he fashioned Love. And Acusilaus agrees with Hesiod. Thus numerous are the witnesses who acknowledge Love to be the eldest of the gods. And not only is he the eldest, he is also the source of the greatest benefits to us. For I know not any greater blessing to a young man who is beginning life than a virtuous lover or to the lover than a beloved youth. For the principle which ought to be the guide of men who would nobly live at principle, I say, neither kindred, nor honour, nor wealth, nor any other motive is able to implant so well as love. Of what am I speaking? Of the sense of honour and dishonour, without which neither states nor individuals ever do any good or great work. And I say that a lover who is detected in doing any dishonourable act, or submitting through cowardice when any dishonour is done to him by another, will be more pained at being detected by his beloved than at being seen by his father, or by his companions, or by any one else. The beloved too, when he is found in any disgraceful situation, has the same feeling about his lover. And if there were only some way of contriving that a state or an army should be made up of lovers and their loves, they would be the very best governors of their own city, abstaining from all dishonour, and emulating one another in honour; and when fighting at each other\\'s side, although a mere handful, they would overcome the world. For what lover would not choose rather to be seen by all mankind than by his beloved, either when abandoning his post or throwing away his arms? He would be ready to die a thousand deaths rather than endure this. Or who would desert his beloved or fail him in the hour of danger? The veriest coward would become an inspired hero, equal to the bravest, at such a time; Love would inspire him. That courage which, as Homer says, the god breathes into the souls of some heroes, Love of his own nature infuses into the lover.\\n\\nLove will make men dare to die for their beloved-love alone; and women as well as men. Of this, Alcestis, the daughter of Pelias, is a monument to all Hellas; for she was willing to lay down her life on behalf of her husband, when no one else would, although he had a father and mother; but the tenderness of her love so far exceeded theirs, that she made them seem to be strangers in blood to their own son, and in name only related to him; and so noble did this action of hers appear to the gods, as well as to men, that among the many who have done virtuously she is one of the very few to whom, in admiration of her noble action, they have granted the privilege of returning alive to earth; such exceeding honour is paid by the gods to the devotion and virtue of love. But Orpheus, the son of Oeagrus, the harper, they sent empty away, and presented to him an apparition only of her whom he sought, but herself they would not give up, because he showed no spirit; he was only a harp-player, and did not-dare like Alcestis to die for love, but was contriving how he might enter hades alive; moreover, they afterwards caused him to suffer death at the hands of women, as the punishment of his cowardliness. Very different was the reward of the true love of Achilles towards his lover Patroclus-his lover and not his love (the notion that Patroclus was the beloved one is a foolish error into which Aeschylus has fallen, for Achilles was surely the fairer of the two, fairer also than all the other heroes; and, as Homer informs us, he was still beardless, and younger far). And greatly as the gods honour the virtue of love, still the return of love on the part of the beloved to the lover is more admired and valued and rewarded by them, for the lover is more divine; because he is inspired by God. Now Achilles was quite aware, for he had been told by his mother, that he might avoid death and return home, and live to a good old age, if he abstained from slaying Hector. Nevertheless he gave his life to revenge his friend, and dared to die, not only in his defence, but after he was dead Wherefore the gods honoured him even above Alcestis, and sent him to the Islands of the Blest. These are my reasons for affirming that Love is the eldest and noblest and mightiest of the gods; and the chiefest author and giver of virtue in life, and of happiness after death.\\n\\nThis, or something like this, was the speech of Phaedrus; and some other speeches followed which Aristodemus did not remember; the next which he repeated was that of Pausanias. Phaedrus, he said, the argument has not been set before us, I think, quite in the right form;-we should not be called upon to praise Love in such an indiscriminate manner. If there were only one Love, then what you said would be well enough; but since there are more Loves than one,-should have begun by determining which of them was to be the theme of our praises. I will amend this defect; and first of all I would tell you which Love is deserving of praise, and then try to hymn the praiseworthy one in a manner worthy of him. For we all know that Love is inseparable from Aphrodite, and if there were only one Aphrodite there would be only one Love; but as there are two goddesses there must be two Loves.\\n\\nAnd am I not right in asserting that there are two goddesses? The elder one, having no mother, who is called the heavenly Aphrodite-she is the daughter of Uranus; the younger, who is the daughter of Zeus and Dione-her we call common; and the Love who is her fellow-worker is rightly named common, as the other love is called heavenly. All the gods ought to have praise given to them, but not without distinction of their natures; and therefore I must try to distinguish the characters of the two Loves. Now actions vary according to the manner of their performance. Take, for example, that which we are now doing, drinking, singing and talking these actions are not in themselves either good or evil, but they turn out in this or that way according to the mode of performing them; and when well done they are good, and when wrongly done they are evil; and in like manner not every love, but only that which has a noble purpose, is noble and worthy of praise. The Love who is the offspring of the common Aphrodite is essentially common, and has no discrimination, being such as the meaner sort of men feel, and is apt to be of women as well as of youths, and is of the body rather than of the soul-the most foolish beings are the objects of this love which desires only to gain an end, but never thinks of accomplishing the end nobly, and therefore does good and evil quite indiscriminately. The goddess who is his mother is far younger than the other, and she was born of the union of the male and female, and partakes of both.\\n\\nBut the offspring of the heavenly Aphrodite is derived from a mother in whose birth the female has no part,-she is from the male only; this is that love which is of youths, and the goddess being older, there is nothing of wantonness in her. Those who are inspired by this love turn to the male, and delight in him who is the more valiant and intelligent nature; any one may recognise the pure enthusiasts in the very character of their attachments. For they love not boys, but intelligent, beings whose reason is beginning to be developed, much about the time at which their beards begin to grow. And in choosing young men to be their companions, they mean to be faithful to them, and pass their whole life in company with them, not to take them in their inexperience, and deceive them, and play the fool with them, or run away from one to another of them. But the love of young boys should be forbidden by law, because their future is uncertain; they may turn out good or bad, either in body or soul, and much noble enthusiasm may be thrown away upon them; in this matter the good are a law to themselves, and the coarser sort of lovers ought to be restrained by force; as we restrain or attempt to restrain them from fixing their affections on women of free birth. These are the persons who bring a reproach on love; and some have been led to deny the lawfulness of such attachments because they see the impropriety and evil of them; for surely nothing that is decorously and lawfully done can justly be censured.\\n\\nNow here and in Lacedaemon the rules about love are perplexing, but in most cities they are simple and easily intelligible; in Elis and Boeotia, and in countries having no gifts of eloquence, they are very straightforward; the law is simply in favour of these connexions, and no one, whether young or old, has anything to say to their discredit; the reason being, as I suppose, that they are men of few words in those parts, and therefore the lovers do not like the trouble of pleading their suit. In Ionia and other places, and generally in countries which are subject to the barbarians, the custom is held to be dishonourable; loves of youths share the evil repute in which philosophy and gymnastics are held because they are inimical to tyranny; for the interests of rulers require that their subjects should be poor in spirit and that there should be no strong bond of friendship or society among them, which love, above all other motives, is likely to inspire, as our Athenian tyrants-learned by experience; for the love of Aristogeiton and the constancy of Harmodius had strength which undid their power. And, therefore, the ill-repute into which these attachments have fallen is to be ascribed to the evil condition of those who make them to be ill-reputed; that is to say, to the self-seeking of the governors and the cowardice of the governed; on the other hand, the indiscriminate honour which is given to them in some countries is attributable to the laziness of those who hold this opinion of them. In our own country a far better principle prevails, but, as I was saying, the explanation of it is rather perplexing. For, observe that open loves are held to be more honourable than secret ones, and that the love of the noblest and highest, even if their persons are less beautiful than others, is especially honourable.\\n\\nConsider, too, how great is the encouragement which all the world gives to the lover; neither is he supposed to be doing anything dishonourable; but if he succeeds he is praised, and if he fail he is blamed. And in the pursuit of his love the custom of mankind allows him to do many strange things, which philosophy would bitterly censure if they were done from any motive of interest, or wish for office or power. He may pray, and entreat, and supplicate, and swear, and lie on a mat at the door, and endure a slavery worse than that of any slave-in any other case friends and enemies would be equally ready to prevent him, but now there is no friend who will be ashamed of him and admonish him, and no enemy will charge him with meanness or flattery; the actions of a lover have a grace which ennobles them; and custom has decided that they are highly commendable and that there no loss of character in them; and, what is strangest of all, he only may swear and forswear himself (so men say), and the gods will forgive his transgression, for there is no such thing as a lover\\'s oath. Such is the entire liberty which gods and men have allowed the lover, according to the custom which prevails in our part of the world. From this point of view a man fairly argues in Athens to love and to be loved is held to be a very honourable thing. But when parents forbid their sons to talk with their lovers, and place them under a tutor\\'s care, who is appointed to see to these things, and their companions and equals cast in their teeth anything of the sort which they may observe, and their elders refuse to silence the reprovers and do not rebuke them-any one who reflects on all this will, on the contrary, think that we hold these practices to be most disgraceful. But, as I was saying at first, the truth as I imagine is, that whether such practices are honourable or whether they are dishonourable is not a simple question; they are honourable to him who follows them honourably, dishonourable to him who follows them dishonourably. There is dishonour in yielding to the evil, or in an evil manner; but there is honour in yielding to the good, or in an honourable manner.\\n\\nEvil is the vulgar lover who loves the body rather than the soul, inasmuch as he is not even stable, because he loves a thing which is in itself unstable, and therefore when the bloom of youth which he was desiring is over, he takes wing and flies away, in spite of all his words and promises; whereas the love of the noble disposition is life-long, for it becomes one with the everlasting. The custom of our country would have both of them proven well and truly, and would have us yield to the one sort of lover and avoid the other, and therefore encourages some to pursue, and others to fly; testing both the lover and beloved in contests and trials, until they show to which of the two classes they respectively belong. And this is the reason why, in the first place, a hasty attachment is held to be dishonourable, because time is the true test of this as of most other things; and secondly there is a dishonour in being overcome by the love of money, or of wealth, or of political power, whether a man is frightened into surrender by the loss of them, or, having experienced the benefits of money and political corruption, is unable to rise above the seductions of them. For none of these things are of a permanent or lasting nature; not to mention that no generous friendship ever sprang from them. There remains, then, only one way of honourable attachment which custom allows in the beloved, and this is the way of virtue; for as we admitted that any service which the lover does to him is not to be accounted flattery or a dishonour to himself, so the beloved has one way only of voluntary service which is not dishonourable, and this is virtuous service.\\n\\nFor we have a custom, and according to our custom any one who does service to another under the idea that he will be improved by him either in wisdom, or, in some other particular of virtue-such a voluntary service, I say, is not to be regarded as a dishonour, and is not open to the charge of flattery. And these two customs, one the love of youth, and the other the practice of philosophy and virtue in general, ought to meet in one, and then the beloved may honourably indulge the lover. For when the lover and beloved come together, having each of them a law, and the lover thinks that he is right in doing any service which he can to his gracious loving one; and the other that he is right in showing any kindness which he can to him who is making him wise and good; the one capable of communicating wisdom and virtue, the other seeking to acquire them with a view to education and wisdom, when the two laws of love are fulfilled and meet in one-then, and then only, may the beloved yield with honour to the lover. Nor when love is of this disinterested sort is there any disgrace in being deceived, but in every other case there is equal disgrace in being or not being deceived. For he who is gracious to his lover under the impression that he is rich, and is disappointed of his gains because he turns out to be poor, is disgraced all the same: for he has done his best to show that he would give himself up to any one\\'s \"uses base\" for the sake of money; but this is not honourable. And on the same principle he who gives himself to a lover because he is a good man, and in the hope that he will be improved by his company, shows himself to be virtuous, even though the object of his affection turn out to be a villain, and to have no virtue; and if he is deceived he has committed a noble error. For he has proved that for his part he will do anything for anybody with a view to virtue and improvement, than which there can be nothing nobler. Thus noble in every case is the acceptance of another for the sake of virtue. This is that love which is the love of the heavenly godess, and is heavenly, and of great price to individuals and cities, making the lover and the beloved alike eager in the work of their own improvement. But all other loves are the offspring of the other, who is the common goddess. To you, Phaedrus, I offer this my contribution in praise of love, which is as good as I could make extempore.\\n\\nPausanias came to a pause-this is the balanced way in which I have been taught by the wise to speak; and Aristodemus said that the turn of Aristophanes was next, but either he had eaten too much, or from some other cause he had the hiccough, and was obliged to change turns with Eryximachus the physician, who was reclining on the couch below him. Eryximachus, he said, you ought either to stop my hiccough, or to speak in my turn until I have left off.\\n\\nI will do both, said Eryximachus: I will speak in your turn, and do you speak in mine; and while I am speaking let me recommend you to hold your breath, and if after you have done so for some time the hiccough is no better, then gargle with a little water; and if it still continues, tickle your nose with something and sneeze; and if you sneeze once or twice, even the most violent hiccough is sure to go. I will do as you prescribe, said Aristophanes, and now get on.\\n\\nEryximachus spoke as follows: Seeing that Pausanias made a fair beginning, and but a lame ending, I must endeavour to supply his deficiency. I think that he has rightly distinguished two kinds of love. But my art further informs me that the double love is not merely an affection of the soul of man towards the fair, or towards anything, but is to be found in the bodies of all animals and in productions of the earth, and I may say in all that is; such is the conclusion which I seem to have gathered from my own art of medicine, whence I learn how great and wonderful and universal is the deity of love, whose empire extends over all things, divine as well as human. And from medicine I would begin that I may do honour to my art. There are in the human body these two kinds of love, which are confessedly different and unlike, and being unlike, they have loves and desires which are unlike; and the desire of the healthy is one, and the desire of the diseased is another; and as Pausanias was just now saying that to indulge good men is honourable, and bad men dishonourable:-so too in the body the good and healthy elements are to be indulged, and the bad elements and the elements of disease are not to be indulged, but discouraged. And this is what the physician has to do, and in this the art of medicine consists: for medicine may be regarded generally as the knowledge of the loves and desires of the body, and how to satisfy them or not; and the best physician is he who is able to separate fair love from foul, or to convert one into the other; and he who knows how to eradicate and how to implant love, whichever is required, and can reconcile the most hostile elements in the constitution and make them loving friends, is skilful practitioner. Now the: most hostile are the most opposite, such as hot and cold, bitter and sweet, moist and dry, and the like. And my ancestor, Asclepius, knowing how-to implant friendship and accord in these elements, was the creator of our art, as our friends the poets here tell us, and I believe them; and not only medicine in every branch but the arts of gymnastic and husbandry are under his dominion.\\n\\nAny one who pays the least attention to the subject will also perceive that in music there is the same reconciliation of opposites; and I suppose that this must have been the meaning, of Heracleitus, although, his words are not accurate, for he says that is united by disunion, like the harmony-of bow and the lyre. Now there is an absurdity saying that harmony is discord or is composed of elements which are still in a state of discord. But what he probably meant was, that, harmony is composed of differing notes of higher or lower pitch which disagreed once, but are now reconciled by the art of music; for if the higher and lower notes still disagreed, there could be there could be no harmony-clearly not. For harmony is a symphony, and symphony is an agreement; but an agreement of disagreements while they disagree there cannot be; you cannot harmonize that which disagrees. In like manner rhythm is compounded of elements short and long, once differing and now-in accord; which accordance, as in the former instance, medicine, so in all these other cases, music implants, making love and unison to grow up among them; and thus music, too, is concerned with the principles of love in their application to harmony and rhythm. Again, in the essential nature of harmony and rhythm there is no difficulty in discerning love which has not yet become double. But when you want to use them in actual life, either in the composition of songs or in the correct performance of airs or metres composed already, which latter is called education, then the difficulty begins, and the good artist is needed. Then the old tale has to be repeated of fair and heavenly love -the love of Urania the fair and heavenly muse, and of the duty of accepting the temperate, and those who are as yet intemperate only that they may become temperate, and of preserving their love; and again, of the vulgar Polyhymnia, who must be used with circumspection that the pleasure be enjoyed, but may not generate licentiousness; just as in my own art it is a great matter so to regulate the desires of the epicure that he may gratify his tastes without the attendant evil of disease. Whence I infer that in music, in medicine, in all other things human as which as divine, both loves ought to be noted as far as may be, for they are both present.\\n\\nThe course of the seasons is also full of both these principles; and when, as I was saying, the elements of hot and cold, moist and dry, attain the harmonious love of one another and blend in temperance and harmony, they bring to men, animals, and plants health and plenty, and do them no harm; whereas the wanton love, getting the upper hand and affecting the seasons of the year, is very destructive and injurious, being the source of pestilence, and bringing many other kinds of diseases on animals and plants; for hoar-frost and hail and blight spring from the excesses and disorders of these elements of love, which to know in relation to the revolutions of the heavenly bodies and the seasons of the year is termed astronomy. Furthermore all sacrifices and the whole province of divination, which is the art of communion between gods and men-these, I say, are concerned with the preservation of the good and the cure of the evil love. For all manner of impiety is likely to ensue if, instead of accepting and honouring and reverencing the harmonious love in all his actions, a man honours the other love, whether in his feelings towards gods or parents, towards the living or the dead. Wherefore the business of divination is to see to these loves and to heal them, and divination is the peacemaker of gods and men, working by a knowledge of the religious or irreligious tendencies which exist in human loves. Such is the great and mighty, or rather omnipotent force of love in general. And the love, more especially, which is concerned with the good, and which is perfected in company with temperance and justice, whether among gods or men, has the greatest power, and is the source of all our happiness and harmony, and makes us friends with the gods who are above us, and with one another. I dare say that I too have omitted several things which might be said in praise of Love, but this was not intentional, and you, Aristophanes, may now supply the omission or take some other line of commendation; for I perceive that you are rid of the hiccough.\\n\\nYes, said Aristophanes, who followed, the hiccough is gone; not, however, until I applied the sneezing; and I wonder whether the harmony of the body has a love of such noises and ticklings, for I no sooner applied the sneezing than I was cured.\\n\\nEryximachus said: Beware, friend Aristophanes, although you are going to speak, you are making fun of me; and I shall have to watch and see whether I cannot have a laugh at your expense, when you might speak in peace.\\n\\nYou are right, said Aristophanes, laughing. I will unsay my words; but do you please not to watch me, as I fear that in the speech which I am about to make, instead of others laughing with me, which is to the manner born of our muse and would be all the better, I shall only be laughed at by them.\\n\\nDo you expect to shoot your bolt and escape, Aristophanes? Well, perhaps if you are very careful and bear in mind that you will be called to account, I may be induced to let you off.\\n\\nAristophanes professed to open another vein of discourse; he had a mind to praise Love in another way, unlike that either of Pausanias or Eryximachus. Mankind; he said, judging by their neglect of him, have never, as I think, at all understood the power of Love. For if they had understood him they would surely have built noble temples and altars, and offered solemn sacrifices in his honour; but this is not done, and most certainly ought to be done: since of all the gods he is the best friend of men, the helper and the healer of the ills which are the great impediment to the happiness of the race. I will try to describe his power to you, and you shall teach the rest of the world what I am teaching you. In the first place, let me treat of the nature of man and what has happened to it; for the original human nature was not like the present, but different. The sexes were not two as they are now, but originally three in number; there was man, woman, and the union of the two, having a name corresponding to this double nature, which had once a real existence, but is now lost, and the word \"Androgynous\" is only preserved as a term of reproach. In the second place, the primeval man was round, his back and sides forming a circle; and he had four hands and four feet, one head with two faces, looking opposite ways, set on a round neck and precisely alike; also four ears, two privy members, and the remainder to correspond. He could walk upright as men now do, backwards or forwards as he pleased, and he could also roll over and over at a great pace, turning on his four hands and four feet, eight in all, like tumblers going over and over with their legs in the air; this was when he wanted to run fast. Now the sexes were three, and such as I have described them; because the sun, moon, and earth are three;-and the man was originally the child of the sun, the woman of the earth, and the man-woman of the moon, which is made up of sun and earth, and they were all round and moved round and round: like their parents. Terrible was their might and strength, and the thoughts of their hearts were great, and they made an attack upon the gods; of them is told the tale of Otys and Ephialtes who, as Homer says, dared to scale heaven, and would have laid hands upon the gods. Doubt reigned in the celestial councils. Should they kill them and annihilate the race with thunderbolts, as they had done the giants, then there would be an end of the sacrifices and worship which men offered to them; but, on the other hand, the gods could not suffer their insolence to be unrestrained.\\n\\nAt last, after a good deal of reflection, Zeus discovered a way. He said: \"Methinks I have a plan which will humble their pride and improve their manners; men shall continue to exist, but I will cut them in two and then they will be diminished in strength and increased in numbers; this will have the advantage of making them more profitable to us. They shall walk upright on two legs, and if they continue insolent and will not be quiet, I will split them again and they shall hop about on a single leg.\" He spoke and cut men in two, like a sorb-apple which is halved for pickling, or as you might divide an egg with a hair; and as he cut them one after another, he bade Apollo give the face and the half of the neck a turn in order that the man might contemplate the section of himself: he would thus learn a lesson of humility. Apollo was also bidden to heal their wounds and compose their forms. So he gave a turn to the face and pulled the skin from the sides all over that which in our language is called the belly, like the purses which draw in, and he made one mouth at the centre, which he fastened in a knot (the same which is called the navel); he also moulded the breast and took out most of the wrinkles, much as a shoemaker might smooth leather upon a last; he left a few, however, in the region of the belly and navel, as a memorial of the primeval state. After the division the two parts of man, each desiring his other half, came together, and throwing their arms about one another, entwined in mutual embraces, longing to grow into one, they were on the point of dying from hunger and self-neglect, because they did not like to do anything apart; and when one of the halves died and the other survived, the survivor sought another mate, man or woman as we call them, being the sections of entire men or women, and clung to that. They were being destroyed, when Zeus in pity of them invented a new plan: he turned the parts of generation round to the front, for this had not been always their position and they sowed the seed no longer as hitherto like grasshoppers in the ground, but in one another; and after the transposition the male generated in the female in order that by the mutual embraces of man and woman they might breed, and the race might continue; or if man came to man they might be satisfied, and rest, and go their ways to the business of life: so ancient is the desire of one another which is implanted in us, reuniting our original nature, making one of two, and healing the state of man.\\n\\nEach of us when separated, having one side only, like a flat fish, is but the indenture of a man, and he is always looking for his other half. Men who are a section of that double nature which was once called Androgynous are lovers of women; adulterers are generally of this breed, and also adulterous women who lust after men: the women who are a section of the woman do not care for men, but have female attachments; the female companions are of this sort. But they who are a section of the male follow the male, and while they are young, being slices of the original man, they hang about men and embrace them, and they are themselves the best of boys and youths, because they have the most manly nature. Some indeed assert that they are shameless, but this is not true; for they do not act thus from any want of shame, but because they are valiant and manly, and have a manly countenance, and they embrace that which is like them. And these when they grow up become our statesmen, and these only, which is a great proof of the truth of what I am saving. When they reach manhood they are loves of youth, and are not naturally inclined to marry or beget children,-if at all, they do so only in obedience to the law; but they are satisfied if they may be allowed to live with one another unwedded; and such a nature is prone to love and ready to return love, always embracing that which is akin to him. And when one of them meets with his other half, the actual half of himself, whether he be a lover of youth or a lover of another sort, the pair are lost in an amazement of love and friendship and intimacy, and would not be out of the other\\'s sight, as I may say, even for a moment: these are the people who pass their whole lives together; yet they could not explain what they desire of one another. For the intense yearning which each of them has towards the other does not appear to be the desire of lover\\'s intercourse, but of something else which the soul of either evidently desires and cannot tell, and of which she has only a dark and doubtful presentiment. Suppose Hephaestus, with his instruments, to come to the pair who are lying side, by side and to say to them, \"What do you people want of one another?\" they would be unable to explain. And suppose further, that when he saw their perplexity he said: \"Do you desire to be wholly one; always day and night to be in one another\\'s company? for if this is what you desire, I am ready to melt you into one and let you grow together, so that being two you shall become one, and while you live a common life as if you were a single man, and after your death in the world below still be one departed soul instead of two-I ask whether this is what you lovingly desire, and whether you are satisfied to attain this?\"-there is not a man of them who when he heard the proposal would deny or would not acknowledge that this meeting and melting into one another, this becoming one instead of two, was the very expression of his ancient need. And the reason is that human nature was originally one and we were a whole, and the desire and pursuit of the whole is called love. There was a time, I say, when we were one, but now because of the wickedness of mankind God has dispersed us, as the Arcadians were dispersed into villages by the Lacedaemonians. And if we are not obedient to the gods, there is a danger that we shall be split up again and go about in basso-relievo, like the profile figures having only half a nose which are sculptured on monuments, and that we shall be like tallies.\\n\\nWherefore let us exhort all men to piety, that we may avoid evil, and obtain the good, of which Love is to us the lord and minister; and let no one oppose him-he is the enemy of the gods who oppose him. For if we are friends of the God and at peace with him we shall find our own true loves, which rarely happens in this world at present. I am serious, and therefore I must beg Eryximachus not to make fun or to find any allusion in what I am saying to Pausanias and Agathon, who, as I suspect, are both of the manly nature, and belong to the class which I have been describing. But my words have a wider application-they include men and women everywhere; and I believe that if our loves were perfectly accomplished, and each one returning to his primeval nature had his original true love, then our race would be happy. And if this would be best of all, the best in the next degree and under present circumstances must be the nearest approach to such an union; and that will be the attainment of a congenial love. Wherefore, if we would praise him who has given to us the benefit, we must praise the god Love, who is our greatest benefactor, both leading us in this life back to our own nature, and giving us high hopes for the future, for he promises that if we are pious, he will restore us to our original state, and heal us and make us happy and blessed. This, Eryximachus, is my discourse of love, which, although different to yours, I must beg you to leave unassailed by the shafts of your ridicule, in order that each may have his turn; each, or rather either, for Agathon and Socrates are the only ones left.\\n\\nIndeed, I am not going to attack you, said Eryximachus, for I thought your speech charming, and did I not know that Agathon and Socrates are masters in the art of love, I should be really afraid that they would have nothing to say, after the world of things which have been said already. But, for all that, I am not without hopes.\\n\\nSocrates said: You played your part well, Eryximachus; but if you were as I am now, or rather as I shall be when Agathon has spoken, you would, indeed, be in a great strait.\\n\\nYou want to cast a spell over me, Socrates, said Agathon, in the hope that I may be disconcerted at the expectation raised among the audience that I shall speak well.\\n\\nI should be strangely forgetful, Agathon replied Socrates, of the courage and magnanimity which you showed when your own compositions were about to be exhibited, and you came upon the stage with the actors and faced the vast theatre altogether undismayed, if I thought that your nerves could be fluttered at a small party of friends.\\n\\nDo you think, Socrates, said Agathon, that my head is so full of the theatre as not to know how much more formidable to a man of sense a few good judges are than many fools?\\n\\nNay, replied Socrates, I should be very wrong in attributing to you, Agathon, that or any other want of refinement. And I am quite aware that if you happened to meet with any whom you thought wise, you would care for their opinion much more than for that of the many. But then we, having been a part of the foolish many in the theatre, cannot be regarded as the select wise; though I know that if you chanced to be in the presence, not of one of ourselves, but of some really wise man, you would be ashamed of disgracing yourself before him-would you not?\\n\\nYes, said Agathon.\\nBut before the many you would not be ashamed, if you thought that you were doing something disgraceful in their presence?\\n\\nHere Phaedrus interrupted them, saying: not answer him, my dear Agathon; for if he can only get a partner with whom he can talk, especially a good-looking one, he will no longer care about the completion of our plan. Now I love to hear him talk; but just at present I must not forget the encomium on Love which I ought to receive from him and from every one. When you and he have paid your tribute to the god, then you may talk.\\n\\nVery good, Phaedrus, said Agathon; I see no reason why I should not proceed with my speech, as I shall have many other opportunities of conversing with Socrates. Let me say first how I ought to speak, and then speak:-\\n\\nThe previous speakers, instead of praising the god Love, or unfolding his nature, appear to have congratulated mankind on the benefits which he confers upon them. But I would rather praise the god first, and then speak of his gifts; this is always the right way of praising everything. May I say without impiety or offence, that of all the blessed gods he is the most blessed because he is the fairest and best? And he is the fairest: for, in the first place, he is the youngest, and of his youth he is himself the witness, fleeing out of the way of age, who is swift enough, swifter truly than most of us like:-Love hates him and will not come near him; but youth and love live and move together-like to like, as the proverb says. Many things were said by Phaedrus about Love in which I agree with him; but I cannot agree that he is older than Iapetus and Kronos:-not so; I maintain him to be the youngest of the gods, and youthful ever. The ancient doings among the gods of which Hesiod and Parmenides spoke, if the tradition of them be true, were done of Necessity and not Love; had Love been in those days, there would have been no chaining or mutilation of the gods, or other violence, but peace and sweetness, as there is now in heaven, since the rule of Love began.\\n\\nLove is young and also tender; he ought to have a poet like Homer to describe his tenderness, as Homer says of Ate, that she is a goddess and tender:\\n\\nHer feet are tender, for she sets her steps,\\nNot on the ground but on the heads of men: herein is an excellent proof of her tenderness that,-she walks not upon the hard but upon the soft. Let us adduce a similar proof of the tenderness of Love; for he walks not upon the earth, nor yet upon skulls of men, which are not so very soft, but in the hearts and souls of both god, and men, which are of all things the softest: in them he walks and dwells and makes his home. Not in every soul without exception, for Where there is hardness he departs, where there is softness there he dwells; and nestling always with his feet and in all manner of ways in the softest of soft places, how can he be other than the softest of all things? Of a truth he is the tenderest as well as the youngest, and also he is of flexile form; for if he were hard and without flexure he could not enfold all things, or wind his way into and out of every soul of man undiscovered. And a proof of his flexibility and symmetry of form is his grace, which is universally admitted to be in an especial manner the attribute of Love; ungrace and love are always at war with one another. The fairness of his complexion is revealed by his habitation among the flowers; for he dwells not amid bloomless or fading beauties, whether of body or soul or aught else, but in the place of flowers and scents, there he sits and abides. Concerning the beauty of the god I have said enough; and yet there remains much more which I might say. Of his virtue I have now to speak: his greatest glory is that he can neither do nor suffer wrong to or from any god or any man; for he suffers not by force if he suffers; force comes not near him, neither when he acts does he act by force. For all men in all things serve him of their own free will, and where there is voluntary agreement, there, as the laws which are the lords of the city say, is justice. And not only is he just but exceedingly temperate, for Temperance is the acknowledged ruler of the pleasures and desires, and no pleasure ever masters Love; he is their master and they are his servants; and if he conquers them he must be temperate indeed. As to courage, even the God of War is no match for him; he is the captive and Love is the lord, for love, the love of Aphrodite, masters him, as the tale runs; and the master is stronger than the servant. And if he conquers the bravest of all others, he must be himself the bravest.\\n\\nOf his courage and justice and temperance I have spoken, but I have yet to speak of his wisdom-and according to the measure of my ability I must try to do my best. In the first place he is a poet (and here, like Eryximachus, I magnify my art), and he is also the source of poesy in others, which he could not be if he were not himself a poet. And at the touch of him every one becomes a poet, even though he had no music in him before; this also is a proof that Love is a good poet and accomplished in all the fine arts; for no one can give to another that which he has not himself, or teach that of which he has no knowledge. Who will deny that the creation of the animals is his doing? Are they not all the works his wisdom, born and begotten of him? And as to the artists, do we not know that he only of them whom love inspires has the light of fame?-he whom Love touches riot walks in darkness. The arts of medicine and archery and divination were discovered by Apollo, under the guidance of love and desire; so that he too is a disciple of Love. Also the melody of the Muses, the metallurgy of Hephaestus, the weaving of Athene, the empire of Zeus over gods and men, are all due to Love, who was the inventor of them. And so Love set in order the empire of the gods-the love of beauty, as is evident, for with deformity Love has no concern. In the days of old, as I began by saying, dreadful deeds were done among the gods, for they were ruled by Necessity; but now since the birth of Love, and from the Love of the beautiful, has sprung every good in heaven and earth. Therefore, Phaedrus, I say of Love that he is the fairest and best in himself, and the cause of what is fairest and best in all other things. And there comes into my mind a line of poetry in which he is said to be the god who\\n\\nGives peace on earth and calms the stormy deep,\\nWho stills the winds and bids the sufferer sleep. This is he who empties men of disaffection and fills them with affection, who makes them to meet together at banquets such as these: in sacrifices, feasts, dances, he is our lord-who sends courtesy and sends away discourtesy, who gives kindness ever and never gives unkindness; the friend of the good, the wonder of the wise, the amazement of the gods; desired by those who have no part in him, and precious to those who have the better part in him; parent of delicacy, luxury, desire, fondness, softness, grace; regardful of the good, regardless of the evil: in every word, work, wish, fear-saviour, pilot, comrade, helper; glory of gods and men, leader best and brightest: in whose footsteps let every man follow, sweetly singing in his honour and joining in that sweet strain with which love charms the souls of gods and men. Such is the speech, Phaedrus, half-playful, yet having a certain measure of seriousness, which, according to my ability, I dedicate to the god.\\n\\nWhen Agathon had done speaking, Aristodemus said that there was a general cheer; the young man was thought to have spoken in a manner worthy of himself, and of the god. And Socrates, looking at Eryximachus, said: Tell me, son of Acumenus, was there not reason in my fears? and was I not a true prophet when I said that Agathon would make a wonderful oration, and that I should be in a strait?\\n\\nThe part of the prophecy which concerns Agathon, replied Eryximachus, appears to me to be true; but, not the other part-that you will be in a strait.\\n\\nWhy, my dear friend, said Socrates, must not I or any one be in a strait who has to speak after he has heard such a rich and varied discourse? I am especially struck with the beauty of the concluding words-who could listen to them without amazement? When I reflected on the immeasurable inferiority of my own powers, I was ready to run away for shame, if there had been a possibility of escape. For I was reminded of Gorgias, and at the end of his speech I fancied that Agathon was shaking at me the Gorginian or Gorgonian head of the great master of rhetoric, which was simply to turn me and my speech, into stone, as Homer says, and strike me dumb. And then I perceived how foolish I had been in consenting to take my turn with you in praising love, and saying that I too was a master of the art, when I really had no conception how anything ought to be praised. For in my simplicity I imagined that the topics of praise should be true, and that this being presupposed, out of the true the speaker was to choose the best and set them forth in the best manner. And I felt quite proud, thinking that I knew the nature of true praise, and should speak well. Whereas I now see that the intention was to attribute to Love every species of greatness and glory, whether really belonging to him not, without regard to truth or falsehood-that was no matter; for the original, proposal seems to have been not that each of you should really praise Love, but only that you should appear to praise him. And so you attribute to Love every imaginable form of praise which can be gathered anywhere; and you say that \"he is all this,\" and \"the cause of all that,\" making him appear the fairest and best of all to those who know him not, for you cannot impose upon those who know him. And a noble and solemn hymn of praise have you rehearsed. But as I misunderstood the nature of the praise when I said that I would take my turn, I must beg to be absolved from the promise which I made in ignorance, and which (as Euripides would say) was a promise of the lips and not of the mind. Farewell then to such a strain: for I do not praise in that way; no, indeed, I cannot. But if you like to here the truth about love, I am ready to speak in my own manner, though I will not make myself ridiculous by entering into any rivalry with you. Say then, Phaedrus, whether you would like, to have the truth about love, spoken in any words and in any order which may happen to come into my mind at the time. Will that be agreeable to you?\\n\\nAristodemus said that Phaedrus and the company bid him speak in any manner which he thought best. Then, he added, let me have your permission first to ask Agathon a few more questions, in order that I may take his admissions as the premisses of my discourse.\\n\\nI grant the permission, said Phaedrus: put your questions. Socrates then proceeded as follows:-\\n\\nIn the magnificent oration which you have just uttered, I think that you were right, my dear Agathon, in proposing to speak of the nature of Love first and afterwards of his works-that is a way of beginning which I very much approve. And as you have spoken so eloquently of his nature, may I ask you further, Whether love is the love of something or of nothing? And here I must explain myself: I do not want you to say that love is the love of a father or the love of a mother-that would be ridiculous; but to answer as you would, if I asked is a father a father of something? to which you would find no difficulty in replying, of a son or daughter: and the answer would be right.\\n\\nVery true, said Agathon.\\nAnd you would say the same of a mother?\\nHe assented.\\nYet let me ask you one more question in order to illustrate my meaning: Is not a brother to be regarded essentially as a brother of something?\\n\\nCertainly, he replied.\\nThat is, of a brother or sister?\\nYes, he said.\\nAnd now, said Socrates, I will ask about Love:-Is Love of something or of nothing?\\n\\nOf something, surely, he replied.\\nKeep in mind what this is, and tell me what I want to know-whether Love desires that of which love is.\\n\\nYes, surely.\\nAnd does he possess, or does he not possess, that which he loves and desires?\\n\\nProbably not, I should say.\\nNay, replied Socrates, I would have you consider whether \"necessarily\" is not rather the word. The inference that he who desires something is in want of something, and that he who desires nothing is in want of nothing, is in my judgment, Agathon absolutely and necessarily true. What do you think?\\n\\nI agree with you, said Agathon.\\nVery good. Would he who is great, desire to be great, or he who is strong, desire to be strong?\\n\\nThat would be inconsistent with our previous admissions.\\n\\nTrue. For he who is anything cannot want to be that which he is?\\nVery true.\\nAnd yet, added Socrates, if a man being strong desired to be strong, or being swift desired to be swift, or being healthy desired to be healthy, in that case he might be thought to desire something which he already has or is. I give the example in order that we may avoid misconception. For the possessors of these qualities, Agathon, must be supposed to have their respective advantages at the time, whether they choose or not; and who can desire that which he has? Therefore when a person says, I am well and wish to be well, or I am rich and wish to be rich, and I desire simply to have what I have-to him we shall reply: \"You, my friend, having wealth and health and strength, want to have the continuance of them; for at this moment, whether you choose or no, you have them. And when you say, I desire that which I have and nothing else, is not your meaning that you want to have what you now have in the future? \"He must agree with us-must he not?\\n\\nHe must, replied Agathon.\\nThen, said Socrates, he desires that what he has at present may be preserved to him in the future, which is equivalent to saying that he desires something which is non-existent to him, and which as yet he has not got.\\n\\nVery true, he said.\\nThen he and every one who desires, desires that which he has not already, and which is future and not present, and which he has not, and is not, and of which he is in want;-these are the sort of things which love and desire seek?\\n\\nVery true, he said.\\nThen now, said Socrates, let us recapitulate the argument. First, is not love of something, and of something too which is wanting to a man?\\n\\nYes, he replied.\\nRemember further what you said in your speech, or if you do not remember I will remind you: you said that the love of the beautiful set in order the empire of the gods, for that of deformed things there is no love-did you not say something of that kind?\\n\\nYes, said Agathon.\\nYes, my friend, and the remark was a just one. And if this is true, Love is the love of beauty and not of deformity?\\n\\nHe assented.\\nAnd the admission has been already made that Love is of something which a man wants and has not?\\n\\nTrue, he said.\\nThen Love wants and has not beauty?\\nCertainly, he replied.\\nAnd would you call that beautiful which wants and does not possess beauty?\\n\\nCertainly not.\\nThen would you still say that love is beautiful?\\nAgathon replied: I fear that I did not understand what I was saying.\\nYou made a very good speech, Agathon, replied Socrates; but there is yet one small question which I would fain ask:-Is not the good also the beautiful?\\n\\nYes.\\nThen in wanting the beautiful, love wants also the good?\\nI cannot refute you, Socrates, said Agathon:-Let us assume that what you say is true.\\n\\nSay rather, beloved Agathon, that you cannot refute the truth; for Socrates is easily refuted.\\n\\nAnd now, taking my leave of you, I would rehearse a tale of love which I heard from Diotima of Mantineia, a woman wise in this and in many other kinds of knowledge, who in the days of old, when the Athenians offered sacrifice before the coming of the plague, delayed the disease ten years. She was my instructress in the art of love, and I shall repeat to you what she said to me, beginning with the admissions made by Agathon, which are nearly if not quite the same which I made to the wise woman when she questioned me-I think that this will be the easiest way, and I shall take both parts myself as well as I can. As you, Agathon, suggested, I must speak first of the being and nature of Love, and then of his works. First I said to her in nearly the same words which he used to me, that Love was a mighty god, and likewise fair and she proved to me as I proved to him that, by my own showing, Love was neither fair nor good. \"What do you mean, Diotima,\" I said, \"is love then evil and foul?\" \"Hush,\" she cried; \"must that be foul which is not fair?\" \"Certainly,\" I said. \"And is that which is not wise, ignorant? do you not see that there is a mean between wisdom and ignorance?\" \"And what may that be?\" I said. \"Right opinion,\" she replied; \"which, as you know, being incapable of giving a reason, is not knowledge (for how can knowledge be devoid of reason? nor again, ignorance, for neither can ignorance attain the truth), but is clearly something which is a mean between ignorance and wisdom.\" \"Quite true,\" I replied. \"Do not then insist,\" she said, \"that what is not fair is of necessity foul, or what is not good evil; or infer that because love is not fair and good he is therefore foul and evil; for he is in a mean between them.\" \"Well,\" I said, \"Love is surely admitted by all to be a great god.\" \"By those who know or by those who do not know?\" \"By all.\" \"And how, Socrates,\" she said with a smile, \"can Love be acknowledged to be a great god by those who say that he is not a god at all?\" \"And who are they?\" I said. \"You and I are two of them,\" she replied. \"How can that be?\" I said. \"It is quite intelligible,\" she replied; \"for you yourself would acknowledge that the gods are happy and fair of course you would-would to say that any god was not?\" \"Certainly not,\" I replied. \"And you mean by the happy, those who are the possessors of things good or fair?\" \"Yes.\" \"And you admitted that Love, because he was in want, desires those good and fair things of which he is in want?\" \"Yes, I did.\" \"But how can he be a god who has no portion in what is either good or fair?\" \"Impossible.\" \"Then you see that you also deny the divinity of Love.\"\\n\\n\"What then is Love?\" I asked; \"Is he mortal?\" \"No.\" \"What then?\" \"As in the former instance, he is neither mortal nor immortal, but in a mean between the two.\" \"What is he, Diotima?\" \"He is a great spirit (daimon), and like all spirits he is intermediate between the divine and the mortal.\" \"And what,\" I said, \"is his power?\" \"He interprets,\" she replied, \"between gods and men, conveying and taking across to the gods the prayers and sacrifices of men, and to men the commands and replies of the gods; he is the mediator who spans the chasm which divides them, and therefore in him all is bound together, and through him the arts of the prophet and the priest, their sacrifices and mysteries and charms, and all, prophecy and incantation, find their way. For God mingles not with man; but through Love. all the intercourse, and converse of god with man, whether awake or asleep, is carried on. The wisdom which understands this is spiritual; all other wisdom, such as that of arts and handicrafts, is mean and vulgar. Now these spirits or intermediate powers are many and diverse, and one of them is Love. \"And who,\" I said, \"was his father, and who his mother?\" \"The tale,\" she said, \"will take time; nevertheless I will tell you. On the birthday of Aphrodite there was a feast of the gods, at which the god Poros or Plenty, who is the son of Metis or Discretion, was one of the guests. When the feast was over, Penia or Poverty, as the manner is on such occasions, came about the doors to beg. Now Plenty who was the worse for nectar (there was no wine in those days), went into the garden of Zeus and fell into a heavy sleep, and Poverty considering her own straitened circumstances, plotted to have a child by him, and accordingly she lay down at his side and conceived love, who partly because he is naturally a lover of the beautiful, and because Aphrodite is herself beautiful, and also because he was born on her birthday, is her follower and attendant. And as his parentage is, so also are his fortunes. In the first place he is always poor, and anything but tender and fair, as the many imagine him; and he is rough and squalid, and has no shoes, nor a house to dwell in; on the bare earth exposed he lies under the open heaven, in-the streets, or at the doors of houses, taking his rest; and like his mother he is always in distress. Like his father too, whom he also partly resembles, he is always plotting against the fair and good; he is bold, enterprising, strong, a mighty hunter, always weaving some intrigue or other, keen in the pursuit of wisdom, fertile in resources; a philosopher at all times, terrible as an enchanter, sorcerer, sophist. He is by nature neither mortal nor immortal, but alive and flourishing at one moment when he is in plenty, and dead at another moment, and again alive by reason of his father\\'s nature. But that which is always flowing in is always flowing out, and so he is never in want and never in wealth; and, further, he is in a mean between ignorance and knowledge. The truth of the matter is this: No god is a philosopher. or seeker after wisdom, for he is wise already; nor does any man who is wise seek after wisdom. Neither do the ignorant seek after Wisdom. For herein is the evil of ignorance, that he who is neither good nor wise is nevertheless satisfied with himself: he has no desire for that of which he feels no want.\" \"But-who then, Diotima,\" I said, \"are the lovers of wisdom, if they are neither the wise nor the foolish?\" \"A child may answer that question,\" she replied; \"they are those who are in a mean between the two; Love is one of them. For wisdom is a most beautiful thing, and Love is of the beautiful; and therefore Love is also a philosopher: or lover of wisdom, and being a lover of wisdom is in a mean between the wise and the ignorant. And of this too his birth is the cause; for his father is wealthy and wise, and his mother poor and foolish. Such, my dear Socrates, is the nature of the spirit Love. The error in your conception of him was very natural, and as I imagine from what you say, has arisen out of a confusion of love and the beloved, which made you think that love was all beautiful. For the beloved is the truly beautiful, and delicate, and perfect, and blessed; but the principle of love is of another nature, and is such as I have described.\"\\n\\nI said, \"O thou stranger woman, thou sayest well; but, assuming Love to be such as you say, what is the use of him to men?\" \"That, Socrates,\" she replied, \"I will attempt to unfold: of his nature and birth I have already spoken; and you acknowledge that love is of the beautiful. But some one will say: Of the beautiful in what, Socrates and Diotima?-or rather let me put the question more dearly, and ask: When a man loves the beautiful, what does he desire?\" I answered her \"That the beautiful may be his.\" \"Still,\" she said, \"the answer suggests a further question: What is given by the possession of beauty?\" \"To what you have asked,\" I replied, \"I have no answer ready.\" \"Then,\" she said, \"Let me put the word \\'good\\' in the place of the beautiful, and repeat the question once more: If he who loves good, what is it then that he loves? \"The possession of the good,\" I said. \"And what does he gain who possesses the good?\" \"Happiness,\" I replied; \"there is less difficulty in answering that question.\" \"Yes,\" she said, \"the happy are made happy by the acquisition of good things. Nor is there any need to ask why a man desires happiness; the answer is already final.\" \"You are right.\" I said. \"And is this wish and this desire common to all? and do all men always desire their own good, or only some men?-what say you?\" \"All men,\" I replied; \"the desire is common to all.\" \"Why, then,\" she rejoined, \"are not all men, Socrates, said to love, but only some them? whereas you say that all men are always loving the same things.\" \"I myself wonder,\" I said,-why this is.\" \"There is nothing to wonder at,\" she replied; \"the reason is that one part of love is separated off and receives the name of the whole, but the other parts have other names.\" \"Give an illustration,\" I said. She answered me as follows: \"There is poetry, which, as you know, is complex; and manifold. All creation or passage of non-being into being is poetry or making, and the processes of all art are creative; and the masters of arts are all poets or makers.\" \"Very true.\" \"Still,\" she said, \"you know that they are not called poets, but have other names; only that portion of the art which is separated off from the rest, and is concerned with music and metre, is termed poetry, and they who possess poetry in this sense of the word are called poets.\" \"Very true,\" I said. \"And the same holds of love. For you may say generally that all desire of good and happiness is only the great and subtle power of love; but they who are drawn towards him by any other path, whether the path of money-making or gymnastics or philosophy, are not called lovers -the name of the whole is appropriated to those whose affection takes one form only-they alone are said to love, or to be lovers.\" \"I dare say,\" I replied, \"that you are right.\" \"Yes,\" she added, \"and you hear people say that lovers are seeking for their other half; but I say that they are seeking neither for the half of themselves, nor for the whole, unless the half or the whole be also a good. And they will cut off their own hands and feet and cast them away, if they are evil; for they love not what is their own, unless perchance there be some one who calls what belongs to him the good, and what belongs to another the evil. For there is nothing which men love but the good. Is there anything?\" \"Certainly, I should say, that there is nothing.\" \"Then,\" she said, \"the simple truth is, that men love the good.\" \"Yes,\" I said. \"To which must be added that they love the possession of the good? \"Yes, that must be added.\" \"And not only the possession, but the everlasting possession of the good?\" \"That must be added too.\" \"Then love,\" she said, \"may be described generally as the love of the everlasting possession of the good?\" \"That is most true.\"\\n\\n\"Then if this be the nature of love, can you tell me further,\" she said, \"what is the manner of the pursuit? what are they doing who show all this eagerness and heat which is called love? and what is the object which they have in view? Answer me.\" \"Nay, Diotima,\" I replied, \"if I had known, I should not have wondered at your wisdom, neither should I have come to learn from you about this very matter.\" \"Well,\" she said, \"I will teach you:-The object which they have in view is birth in beauty, whether of body or, soul.\" \"I do not understand you,\" I said; \"the oracle requires an explanation.\" \"I will make my meaning dearer,\" she replied. \"I mean to say, that all men are bringing to the birth in their bodies and in their souls. There is a certain age at which human nature is desirous of procreation-procreation which must be in beauty and not in deformity; and this procreation is the union of man and woman, and is a divine thing; for conception and generation are an immortal principle in the mortal creature, and in the inharmonious they can never be. But the deformed is always inharmonious with the divine, and the beautiful harmonious. Beauty, then, is the destiny or goddess of parturition who presides at birth, and therefore, when approaching beauty, the conceiving power is propitious, and diffusive, and benign, and begets and bears fruit: at the sight of ugliness she frowns and contracts and has a sense of pain, and turns away, and shrivels up, and not without a pang refrains from conception. And this is the reason why, when the hour of conception arrives, and the teeming nature is full, there is such a flutter and ecstasy about beauty whose approach is the alleviation of the pain of travail. For love, Socrates, is not, as you imagine, the love of the beautiful only.\" \"What then?\" \"The love of generation and of birth in beauty.\" \"Yes,\" I said. \"Yes, indeed,\" she replied. \"But why of generation?\" \"Because to the mortal creature, generation is a sort of eternity and immortality,\" she replied; \"and if, as has been already admitted, love is of the everlasting possession of the good, all men will necessarily desire immortality together with good: Wherefore love is of immortality.\"\\n\\nAll this she taught me at various times when she spoke of love. And I remember her once saying to me, \"What is the cause, Socrates, of love, and the attendant desire? See you not how all animals, birds, as well as beasts, in their desire of procreation, are in agony when they take the infection of love, which begins with the desire of union; whereto is added the care of offspring, on whose behalf the weakest are ready to battle against the strongest even to the uttermost, and to die for them, and will, let themselves be tormented with hunger or suffer anything in order to maintain their young. Man may be supposed to act thus from reason; but why should animals have these passionate feelings? Can you tell me why?\" Again I replied that I did not know. She said to me: \"And do you expect ever to become a master in the art of love, if you do not know this?\" \"But I have told you already, Diotima, that my ignorance is the reason why I come to you; for I am conscious that I want a teacher; tell me then the cause of this and of the other mysteries of love.\" \"Marvel not,\" she said, \"if you believe that love is of the immortal, as we have several times acknowledged; for here again, and on the same principle too, the mortal nature is seeking as far as is possible to be everlasting and immortal: and this is only to be attained by generation, because generation always leaves behind a new existence in the place of the old. Nay even in the life, of the same individual there is succession and not absolute unity: a man is called the same, and yet in the short interval which elapses between youth and age, and in which every animal is said to have life and identity, he is undergoing a perpetual process of loss and reparation-hair, flesh, bones, blood, and the whole body are always changing. Which is true not only of the body, but also of the soul, whose habits, tempers, opinions, desires, pleasures, pains, fears, never remain the same in any one of us, but are always coming and going; and equally true of knowledge, and what is still more surprising to us mortals, not only do the sciences in general spring up and decay, so that in respect of them we are never the same; but each of them individually experiences a like change. For what is implied in the word \\'recollection,\\' but the departure of knowledge, which is ever being forgotten, and is renewed and preserved by recollection, and appears to be the same although in reality new, according to that law of succession by which all mortal things are preserved, not absolutely the same, but by substitution, the old worn-out mortality leaving another new and similar existence behind unlike the divine, which is always the same and not another? And in this way, Socrates, the mortal body, or mortal anything, partakes of immortality; but the immortal in another way. Marvel not then at the love which all men have of their offspring; for that universal love and interest is for the sake of immortality.\"\\n\\nI was astonished at her words, and said: \"Is this really true, O thou wise Diotima?\" And she answered with all the authority of an accomplished sophist: \"Of that, Socrates, you may be assured;-think only of the ambition of men, and you will wonder at the senselessness of their ways, unless you consider how they are stirred by the love of an immortality of fame. They are ready to run all risks greater far than they would have for their children, and to spend money and undergo any sort of toil, and even to die, for the sake of leaving behind them a name which shall be eternal. Do you imagine that Alcestis would have died to save Admetus, or Achilles to avenge Patroclus, or your own Codrus in order to preserve the kingdom for his sons, if they had not imagined that the memory of their virtues, which still survives among us, would be immortal? Nay,\" she said, \"I am persuaded that all men do all things, and the better they are the more they do them, in hope of the glorious fame of immortal virtue; for they desire the immortal.\\n\\n\"Those who are pregnant in the body only, betake themselves to women and beget children-this is the character of their love; their offspring, as they hope, will preserve their memory and giving them the blessedness and immortality which they desire in the future. But souls which are pregnant-for there certainly are men who are more creative in their souls than in their bodies conceive that which is proper for the soul to conceive or contain. And what are these conceptions?-wisdom and virtue in general. And such creators are poets and all artists who are deserving of the name inventor. But the greatest and fairest sort of wisdom by far is that which is concerned with the ordering of states and families, and which is called temperance and justice. And he who in youth has the seed of these implanted in him and is himself inspired, when he comes to maturity desires to beget and generate. He wanders about seeking beauty that he may beget offspring-for in deformity he will beget nothing-and naturally embraces the beautiful rather than the deformed body; above all when he finds fair and noble and well-nurtured soul, he embraces the two in one person, and to such an one he is full of speech about virtue and the nature and pursuits of a good man; and he tries to educate him; and at the touch of the beautiful which is ever present to his memory, even when absent, he brings forth that which he had conceived long before, and in company with him tends that which he brings forth; and they are married by a far nearer tie and have a closer friendship than those who beget mortal children, for the children who are their common offspring are fairer and more immortal. Who, when he thinks of Homer and Hesiod and other great poets, would not rather have their children than ordinary human ones? Who would not emulate them in the creation of children such as theirs, which have preserved their memory and given them everlasting glory? Or who would not have such children as Lycurgus left behind him to be the saviours, not only of Lacedaemon, but of Hellas, as one may say? There is Solon, too, who is the revered father of Athenian laws; and many others there are in many other places, both among hellenes and barbarians, who have given to the world many noble works, and have been the parents of virtue of every kind; and many temples have been raised in their honour for the sake of children such as theirs; which were never raised in honour of any one, for the sake of his mortal children.\\n\\n\"These are the lesser mysteries of love, into which even you, Socrates, may enter; to the greater and more hidden ones which are the crown of these, and to which, if you pursue them in a right spirit, they will lead, I know not whether you will be able to attain. But I will do my utmost to inform you, and do you follow if you can. For he who would proceed aright in this matter should begin in youth to visit beautiful forms; and first, if he be guided by his instructor aright, to love one such form only-out of that he should create fair thoughts; and soon he will of himself perceive that the beauty of one form is akin to the beauty of another; and then if beauty of form in general is his pursuit, how foolish would he be not to recognize that the beauty in every form is and the same! And when he perceives this he will abate his violent love of the one, which he will despise and deem a small thing, and will become a lover of all beautiful forms; in the next stage he will consider that the beauty of the mind is more honourable than the beauty of the outward form. So that if a virtuous soul have but a little comeliness, he will be content to love and tend him, and will search out and bring to the birth thoughts which may improve the young, until he is compelled to contemplate and see the beauty of institutions and laws, and to understand that the beauty of them all is of one family, and that personal beauty is a trifle; and after laws and institutions he will go on to the sciences, that he may see their beauty, being not like a servant in love with the beauty of one youth or man or institution, himself a slave mean and narrow-minded, but drawing towards and contemplating the vast sea of beauty, he will create many fair and noble thoughts and notions in boundless love of wisdom; until on that shore he grows and waxes strong, and at last the vision is revealed to him of a single science, which is the science of beauty everywhere. To this I will proceed; please to give me your very best attention:\\n\\n\"He who has been instructed thus far in the things of love, and who has learned to see the beautiful in due order and succession, when he comes toward the end will suddenly perceive a nature of wondrous beauty (and this, Socrates, is the final cause of all our former toils)-a nature which in the first place is everlasting, not growing and decaying, or waxing and waning; secondly, not fair in one point of view and foul in another, or at one time or in one relation or at one place fair, at another time or in another relation or at another place foul, as if fair to some and-foul to others, or in the likeness of a face or hands or any other part of the bodily frame, or in any form of speech or knowledge, or existing in any other being, as for example, in an animal, or in heaven or in earth, or in any other place; but beauty absolute, separate, simple, and everlasting, which without diminution and without increase, or any change, is imparted to the ever-growing and perishing beauties of all other things. He who from these ascending under the influence of true love, begins to perceive that beauty, is not far from the end. And the true order of going, or being led by another, to the things of love, is to begin from the beauties of earth and mount upwards for the sake of that other beauty, using these as steps only, and from one going on to two, and from two to all fair forms, and from fair forms to fair practices, and from fair practices to fair notions, until from fair notions he arrives at the notion of absolute beauty, and at last knows what the essence of beauty is. This, my dear Socrates,\" said the stranger of Mantineia, \"is that life above all others which man should live, in the contemplation of beauty absolute; a beauty which if you once beheld, you would see not to be after the measure of gold, and garments, and fair boys and youths, whose presence now entrances you; and you and many a one would be content to live seeing them only and conversing with them without meat or drink, if that were possible-you only want to look at them and to be with them. But what if man had eyes to see the true beauty-the divine beauty, I mean, pure and dear and unalloyed, not clogged with the pollutions of mortality and all the colours and vanities of human life-thither looking, and holding converse with the true beauty simple and divine? Remember how in that communion only, beholding beauty with the eye of the mind, he will be enabled to bring forth, not images of beauty, but realities (for he has hold not of an image but of a reality), and bringing forth and nourishing true virtue to become the friend of God and be immortal, if mortal man may. Would that be an ignoble life?\"\\n\\nSuch, Phaedrus-and I speak not only to you, but to all of you-were the words of Diotima; and I am persuaded of their truth. And being persuaded of them, I try to persuade others, that in the attainment of this end human nature will not easily find a helper better than love: And therefore, also, I say that every man ought to honour him as I myself honour him, and walk in his ways, and exhort others to do the same, and praise the power and spirit of love according to the measure of my ability now and ever.\\n\\nThe words which I have spoken, you, Phaedrus, may call an encomium of love, or anything else which you please.\\n\\nWhen Socrates had done speaking, the company applauded, and Aristophanes was beginning to say something in answer to the allusion which Socrates had made to his own speech, when suddenly there was a great knocking at the door of the house, as of revellers, and the sound of a flute-girl was heard. Agathon told the attendants to go and see who were the intruders. \"If they are friends of ours,\" he said, \"invite them in, but if not, say that the drinking is over.\" A little while afterwards they heard the voice of Alcibiades resounding in the court; he was in a great state of intoxication and kept roaring and shouting \"Where is Agathon? Lead me to Agathon,\" and at length, supported by the flute-girl and some of his attendants, he found his way to them. \"Hail, friends,\" he said, appearing-at the door crown, with a massive garland of ivy and violets, his head flowing with ribands. \"Will you have a very drunken man as a companion of your revels? Or shall I crown Agathon, which was my intention in coming, and go away? For I was unable to come yesterday, and therefore I am here to-day, carrying on my head these ribands, that taking them from my own head, I may crown the head of this fairest and wisest of men, as I may be allowed to call him. Will you laugh at me because I am drunk? Yet I know very well that I am speaking the truth, although you may laugh. But first tell me; if I come in shall we have the understanding of which I spoke? Will you drink with me or not?\"\\n\\nThe company were vociferous in begging that he would take his place among them, and Agathon specially invited him. Thereupon he was led in by the people who were with him; and as he was being led, intending to crown Agathon, he took the ribands from his own head and held them in front of his eyes; he was thus prevented from seeing Socrates, who made way for him, and Alcibiades took the vacant place between Agathon and Socrates, and in taking the place he embraced Agathon and crowned him. Take off his sandals, said Agathon, and let him make a third on the same couch.\\n\\nBy all means; but who makes the third partner in our revels? said Alcibiades, turning round and starting up as he caught sight of Socrates. By Heracles, he said, what is this? here is Socrates always lying in wait for me, and always, as his way is, coming out at all sorts of unsuspected places: and now, what have you to say for yourself, and why are you lying here, where I perceive that you have contrived to find a place, not by a joker or lover of jokes, like Aristophanes, but by the fairest of the company?\\n\\nSocrates turned to Agathon and said: I must ask you to protect me, Agathon; for the passion of this man has grown quite a serious matter to me. Since I became his admirer I have never been allowed to speak to any other fair one, or so much as to look at them. If I do, he goes wild with envy and jealousy, and not only abuses me but can hardly keep his hands off me, and at this moment he may do me some harm. Please to see to this, and either reconcile me to him, or, if he attempts violence, protect me, as I am in bodily fear of his mad and passionate attempts.\\n\\nThere can never be reconciliation between you and me, said Alcibiades; but for the present I will defer your chastisement. And I must beg you, Agathoron, to give me back some of the ribands that I may crown the marvellous head of this universal despot-I would not have him complain of me for crowning you, and neglecting him, who in conversation is the conqueror of all mankind; and this not only once, as you were the day before yesterday, but always. Whereupon, taking some of the ribands, he crowned Socrates, and again reclined.\\n\\nThen he said: You seem, my friends, to be sober, which is a thing not to be endured; you must drink-for that was the agreement under which I was admitted-and I elect myself master of the feast until you are well drunk. Let us have a large goblet, Agathon, or rather, he said, addressing the attendant, bring me that wine-cooler. The wine-cooler which had caught his eye was a vessel holding more than two quarts-this he filled and emptied, and bade the attendant fill it again for Socrates. Observe, my friends, said Alcibiades, that this ingenious trick of mine will have no effect on Socrates, for he can drink any quantity of wine and not be at all nearer being drunk. Socrates drank the cup which the attendant filled for him.\\n\\nEryximachus said! What is this Alcibiades? Are we to have neither conversation nor singing over our cups; but simply to drink as if we were thirsty?\\n\\nAlcibiades replied: Hail, worthy son of a most wise and worthy sire!\\n\\nThe same to you, said Eryximachus; but what shall we do?\\n\\nThat I leave to you, said Alcibiades.\\n\\nThe wise physician skilled our wounds to heal shall prescribe and we will obey. What do you want?\\n\\nWell, said Eryximachus, before you appeared we had passed a resolution that each one of us in turn should make a speech in praise of love, and as good a one as he could: the turn was passed round from left to right; and as all of us have spoken, and you have not spoken but have well drunken, you ought to speak, and then impose upon Socrates any task which you please, and he on his right hand neighbour, and so on.\\n\\nThat is good, Eryximachus, said Alcibiades; and yet the comparison, of a drunken man\\'s speech with those of sober men is hardly fair; and I should like to know, sweet friend, whether you really believe-what Socrates was just now saying; for I can assure you that the very reverse is the fact, and that if I praise any one but himself in his presence, whether God or man, he will hardly keep his hands off me.\\n\\nFor shame, said Socrates. Hold your tongue, said Alcibiades, for by Poseidon, there is no one else whom I will praise when you are-of the company.\\n\\nWell then, said Eryximachus, if you like praise Socrates.\\n\\nWhat do you think, Eryximachus-? said Alcibiades: shall I attack him: and inflict the punishment before you all?\\n\\nWhat are you about? said Socrates; are you going to raise a laugh at my expense? Is that the meaning of your praise?\\n\\nI am going to speak the truth, if you will permit me. I not only permit, but exhort you to speak the truth. Then I will begin at once, said Alcibiades, and if I say anything which is not true, you may interrupt me if you will, and say \"that is a lie,\" though my intention is to speak the truth. But you must not wonder if I speak any how as things come into my mind; for the fluent and orderly enumeration of all your singularities is not a task which is easy to a man in my condition.\\n\\nAnd now, my boys, I shall praise Socrates in a figure which will appear to him to be a caricature, and yet I speak, not to make fun of him, but only for the truth\\'s sake. I say, that he is exactly like the busts of Silenus, which are set up in the statuaries, shops, holding pipes and flutes in their mouths; and they are made to open in the middle, and have images of gods inside them. I say also that hit is like Marsyas the satyr. You yourself will not deny, Socrates, that your face is like that of a satyr. Aye, and there is a resemblance in other points too. For example, you are a bully, as I can prove by witnesses, if you will not confess. And are you not a flute-player? That you are, and a performer far more wonderful than Marsyas. He indeed with instruments used to charm the souls of men by the powers of his breath, and the players of his music do so still: for the melodies of Olympus are derived from Marsyas who taught them, and these, whether they are played by a great master or by a miserable flute-girl, have a power which no others have; they alone possess the soul and reveal the wants of those who have need of gods and mysteries, because they are divine. But you produce the same effect with your words only, and do not require the flute; that is the difference between you and him. When we hear any other speaker, even very good one, he produces absolutely no effect upon us, or not much, whereas the mere fragments of you and your words, even at second-hand, and however imperfectly repeated, amaze and possess the souls of every man, woman, and child who comes within hearing of them. And if I were not, afraid that you would think me hopelessly drunk, I would have sworn as well as spoken to the influence which they have always had and still have over me. For my heart leaps within me more than that of any Corybantian reveller, and my eyes rain tears when I hear them. And I observe that many others are affected in the same manner. I have heard Pericles and other great orators, and I thought that they spoke well, but I never had any similar feeling; my soul was not stirred by them, nor was I angry at the thought of my own slavish state. But this Marsyas has often brought me to such pass, that I have felt as if I could hardly endure the life which I am leading (this, Socrates, you will admit); and I am conscious that if I did not shut my ears against him, and fly as from the voice of the siren, my fate would be like that of others,-he would transfix me, and I should grow old sitting at his feet. For he makes me confess that I ought not to live as I do, neglecting the wants of my own soul, and busying myself with the concerns of the Athenians; therefore I hold my ears and tear myself away from him. And he is the only person who ever made me ashamed, which you might think not to be in my nature, and there is no one else who does the same. For I know that I cannot answer him or say that I ought not to do as he bids, but when I leave his presence the love of popularity gets the better of me. And therefore I run away and fly from him, and when I see him I am ashamed of what I have confessed to him. Many a time have I wished that he were dead, and yet I know that I should be much more sorry than glad, if he were to die: so that am at my wit\\'s end.\\n\\nAnd this is what I and many others have suffered, from the flute-playing of this satyr. Yet hear me once more while I show you how exact the image is, and. how marvellous his power. For let me tell you; none of you know him; but I will reveal him to you; having begun, I must go on. See you how fond he is of the fair? He is always with them and is always being smitten by them, and then again he knows nothing and is ignorant of all thing such is the appearance')]"

A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online  \\npayments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a  \\nfinancial institution.  Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main  \\nbenefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.  \\nWe propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.  \\nThe network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of  \\nhash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing  \\nthe proof-of-work.  The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of  \\nevents witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power.  As  \\nlong as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to  \\nattack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers.  The  \\nnetwork itself requires minimal structure.  Messages are broadcast on a best effort  \\nbasis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest  \\nproof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.\\n1.Introduction\\nCommerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as  \\ntrusted third parties to process electronic payments.  While the system works well enough for  \\nmost  transactions,  it  still  suffers  from  the  inherent  weaknesses  of  the  trust  based  model.  \\nCompletely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot  \\navoid  mediating  disputes.   The  cost  of  mediation  increases  transaction  costs,  limiting  the  \\nminimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions,  \\nand there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-\\nreversible services.  With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads.  Merchants must  \\nbe wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.  \\nA certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable.  These costs and payment uncertainties  \\ncan be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments  \\nover a communications channel without a trusted party.\\nWhat is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust,  \\nallowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted  \\nthird party.  Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers  \\nfrom fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers.  In  \\nthis paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed  \\ntimestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions.  The  \\nsystem  is  secure  as  long  as  honest  nodes  collectively  control  more  CPU  power  than  any  \\ncooperating group of attacker nodes.\\n1\"),\n",

Each owner transfers the coin to the  \\nnext by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner  \\nand adding these to the end of the coin.  A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of  \\nownership.\\nThe problem of course is the payee can't verify that one of the owners did not double-spend  \\nthe coin.  A common solution is to introduce a trusted central authority, or mint, that checks every  \\ntransaction for double spending.  After each transaction, the coin must be returned to the mint to  \\nissue a new coin, and only coins issued directly from the mint are trusted not to be double-spent.  \\nThe problem with this solution is that the fate of the entire money system depends on the  \\ncompany running the mint, with every transaction having to go through them, just like a bank.\\nWe need a way for the payee to know that the previous owners did not sign any earlier  \\ntransactions.  For our purposes, the earliest transaction is the one that counts, so we don't care  \\nabout later attempts to double-spend.  The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to  \\nbe aware of all transactions.  In the mint based model, the mint was aware of all transactions and  \\ndecided which arrived first.  To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be  \\npublicly announced [1], and we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the  \\norder in which they were received.  The payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction, the  \\nmajority of nodes agreed it was the first received. \\n3.Timestamp Server\\nThe solution we propose begins with a timestamp server.  A timestamp server works by taking a  \\nhash  of a block of items  to  be timestamped  and  widely publishing  the hash,  such as  in  a  \\nnewspaper or Usenet post [2-5].  The timestamp proves that the data must have existed at the  \\ntime, obviously, in order to get into the hash.  Each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in  \\nits hash, forming a chain, with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones before it.\\n2Block\\nItemItem...Hash\\nBlock\\nItemItem...HashTransaction\\nOwner 1'sPublic Key\\nOwner 0'sSignatureHashTransaction\\nOwner 2'sPublic Key\\nOwner 1'sSignatureHash\\n VerifyTransaction\\nOwner 3'sPublic Key\\nOwner 2'sSignatureHash\\n Verify\\nOwner 2'sPrivate KeyOwner 1'sPrivate KeySign  Sign  \\nOwner 3'sPrivate Key\"),\n",

The average work required is exponential in the number  \\nof zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash.\\nFor our timestamp network, we implement the proof-of-work by incrementing a nonce in the  \\nblock until a value is found that gives the block's hash the required zero bits.  Once the CPU  \\neffort has been expended to make it satisfy the proof-of-work, the block cannot be changed  \\nwithout redoing the work.  As later blocks are chained after it, the work to change the block  \\nwould include redoing all the blocks after it.\\nThe proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision  \\nmaking.  If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone  \\nable  to  allocate  many  IPs.   Proof-of-work  is  essentially  one-CPU-one-vote.   The  majority  \\ndecision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested  \\nin it.  If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the  \\nfastest and outpace any competing chains.  To modify a past block, an attacker would have to  \\nredo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the  \\nwork of the honest nodes.  We will show later that the probability of a slower attacker catching up  \\ndiminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added.\\nTo compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time,  \\nthe proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of  \\nblocks per hour.  If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases.\\n5.Network\\nThe steps to run the network are as follows:\\n1)New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.\\n2)Each node collects new transactions into a block.  \\n3)Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.\\n4)When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.\\n5)Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.\\n6)Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the  \\nchain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.\\nNodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on  \\nextending it.  If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some  \\nnodes may receive one or the other first.  In that case, they work on the first one they received,  \\nbut save the other branch in case it becomes longer.  The tie will be broken when the next proof-\\nof-work is found and one branch becomes longer; the nodes that were working on the other  \\nbranch will then switch to the longer one.\\n3Block\\nPrev HashNonce\\nTxTx...Block\\nPrev HashNonce\\nTxTx...\"),\n",

As long as they reach  \\nmany nodes, they will get into a block before long.  Block broadcasts are also tolerant of dropped  \\nmessages.  If a node does not receive a block, it will request it when it receives the next block and  \\nrealizes it missed one.\\n6.Incentive\\nBy convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned  \\nby the creator of the block.  This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides  \\na way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them.  \\nThe steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending  \\nresources to add gold to circulation.  In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.\\nThe incentive can also be funded with transaction fees.  If the output value of a transaction is  \\nless than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of  \\nthe block  containing  the transaction.   Once  a  predetermined number of coins  have  entered  \\ncirculation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation  \\nfree.\\nThe incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest.  If a greedy attacker is able to  \\nassemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it  \\nto defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins.  He ought to  \\nfind it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than  \\neveryone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.\\n7.Reclaiming Disk Space\\nOnce the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before  \\nit can be discarded to save disk space.  To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash,  \\ntransactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash.  \\nOld blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree.  The interior hashes do  \\nnot need to be stored.\\nA block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes.  If we suppose blocks are  \\ngenerated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year.  With computer systems  \\ntypically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of  \\n1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in  \\nmemory.\\n4Block BlockBlock Header (Block Hash)\\nPrev HashNonce\\nHash01\\nHash0Hash1Hash2Hash3Hash23Root Hash\\nHash01\\nHash2\\nTx3Hash23Block Header (Block Hash)\\nRoot Hash\\nTransactions Hashed in a Merkle Tree After Pruning Tx0-2 from the BlockPrev HashNonce\\nHash3\\nTx0Tx1Tx2Tx3\"),\n",

A user only needs to keep  \\na copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying  \\nnetwork nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch  \\nlinking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in.  He can't check the transaction for  \\nhimself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it,  \\nand blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it.\\nAs such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more  \\nvulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker.  While network nodes can verify  \\ntransactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated  \\ntransactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network.  One strategy to  \\nprotect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid  \\nblock, prompting the user's  software to download the full  block and alerted transactions to  \\nconfirm the inconsistency.  Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to  \\nrun their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.\\n9.Combining and Splitting Value\\nAlthough it would be possible to handle coins individually, it would be unwieldy to make a  \\nseparate transaction for every cent in a transfer.  To allow value to be split and combined,  \\ntransactions contain multiple inputs and outputs.  Normally there will be either a single input  \\nfrom a larger previous transaction or multiple inputs combining smaller amounts, and at most two  \\noutputs: one for the payment, and one returning the change, if any, back to the sender.  \\nIt should be noted that fan-out, where a transaction depends on several transactions, and those  \\ntransactions depend on many more, is not a problem here.  There is never the need to extract a  \\ncomplete standalone copy of a transaction's history.\\n5Transaction\\nIn\\n...InOut\\n...Hash01\\nHash2Hash3Hash23Block Header\\nMerkle RootPrev HashNonceBlock Header\\nMerkle RootPrev HashNonceBlock Header\\nMerkle RootPrev HashNonce\\nMerkle Branch for Tx3Longest Proof-of-Work Chain\\nTx3\"),\n",

The necessity to announce all transactions publicly  \\nprecludes this method, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in  \\nanother place: by keeping public keys anonymous.  The public can see that someone is sending  \\nan amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone.  This is  \\nsimilar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of  \\nindividual trades, the \"tape\", is made public, but without telling who the parties were.\\nAs an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them  \\nfrom being linked to a common owner.  Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input  \\ntransactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner.  The risk  \\nis that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to  \\nthe same owner.\\n11.Calculations\\nWe consider the scenario of an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest  \\nchain.  Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such  \\nas creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker.  Nodes are  \\nnot going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block  \\ncontaining them.  An attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back  \\nmoney he recently spent.\\nThe race between the honest chain and an attacker chain can be characterized as a Binomial  \\nRandom Walk.  The success event is the honest chain being extended by one block, increasing its  \\nlead by +1, and the failure event is the attacker\\'s chain being extended by one block, reducing the  \\ngap by -1.\\nThe probability of an attacker catching up from a given deficit is analogous to a Gambler\\'s  \\nRuin problem.  Suppose a gambler with unlimited credit starts at a deficit and plays potentially an  \\ninfinite number of trials to try to reach breakeven.  We can calculate the probability he ever  \\nreaches breakeven, or that an attacker ever catches up with the honest chain, as follows [8]:\\np = probability an honest node finds the next block\\nq = probability the attacker finds the next block\\nqz = probability the attacker will ever catch up from z blocks behind\\nqz={1ifp≤q\\n\\ue09eq/p\\ue09fzifp\\ue085q}\\n6IdentitiesTransactionsTrustedThird PartyCounterpartyPublic\\nIdentitiesTransactionsPublicNew Privacy ModelTraditional Privacy Model'),\n",

We assume the sender is an attacker  \\nwho wants to make the recipient believe he paid him for a while, then switch it to pay back to  \\nhimself after some time has passed.

The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity.  Nodes  \\nwork all at once with little coordination.  They do not need to be identified, since messages are  \\nnot routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis.  Nodes can  \\nleave  and  rejoin  the  network  at  will,  accepting  the  proof-of-work  chain  as  proof  of  what  \\nhappened while they were gone.  They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of  \\nvalid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on  \\nthem.  Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.\\n8'),\n",

The men include the philosopher Socrates, the general and statesman Alcibiades, and the comic playwright Aristophanes. The panegyrics are to be given in praise of Eros, the god of love and sex.\\nIn the Symposium, Eros is recognized both as erotic lover and as a phenomenon capable of inspiring courage, valor, great deeds and works, and vanquishing man\\'s natural fear of death. It is seen as transcending its earthly origins and attaining spiritual heights. The extraordinary elevation of the concept of love raises a question of whether some of the most extreme extents of meaning might be intended as humor or farce. Eros is almost always translated as \"love,\" and the English word has its own varieties and ambiguities that provide additional challenges to the effort to understand the Eros of ancient Athens.[3][4][5]\\nThe dialogue is one of Plato\\'s major works, and is appreciated for both its philosophical content and its literary qualities.[5]\\n\\n\\nSetting[edit]\\nThe dialogue takes place at a banquet in the year 416 BC at the house of the tragedian Agathon in Athens.[6]\\n\\nPrincipal characters[edit]\\nThe dialogue\\'s seven main characters, who deliver major speeches, are:\\n\\nPhaedrus (speech begins 178a):[7] an Athenian aristocrat associated with the inner-circle of the philosopher Socrates, familiar from Phaedrus and other dialogues\\nPausanias (speech begins 180c): the legal expert\\nEryximachus (speech begins 186a): a physician\\nAristophanes (speech begins 189c): the eminent comic playwright\\nAgathon (speech begins 195a): a tragic poet, host of the banquet, that celebrates the triumph of his first tragedy\\nSocrates (speech begins 201d): the eminent philosopher and Plato\\'s teacher\\nAlcibiades (speech begins 214e): a prominent Athenian statesman, orator, and general\\nBackground[edit]\\nIn Ancient Greece, the type of banquet depicted in the dialogue, a symposium, was traditionally attended by a group of men, who would first partake in a meal, followed by drinking for pleasure, which was accompanied by music, dancing, recitals, or conversation.[8] The setting means that the participants would be drinking wine, meaning that the men might be induced to say things they would not say elsewhere or when sober. They might speak more frankly, or take more risks, or else be prone to hubris—they might even be inspired to make speeches that are particularly heartfelt and noble.[9]\\nThe dialogue takes place in 416, the year in which the host Agathon had the dramatic triumph mentioned in the text. The disastrous expedition to Syracuse, of which Alcibiades was a commander, took place the following year,[10] after which Alcibiades deserted to Sparta, Athens\\' archenemy.\\n\\nStyle, dating and authorship[edit]\\nSocrates is renowned for his Socratic method, which involves posing questions that encourage others to think deeply about what they care about and articulate their ideas. Unlike most of Plato\\'s works, which take the form of a back-and-forth Socratic dialogue, between Socrates and one or more interlocutors, the Symposium is a series of speeches from different characters. However, the underlying philosophical method remains the same; examining the conflict in ideas between the different speeches can allow the reader to see the philosophy that underlies them all.[11]\\nThe work was written by Plato, no earlier than 385 BC.[citation needed] The characters are historical, but this is not a report of historical events. There is no reason to doubt that they were composed entirely by Plato.[citation needed] The reader, understanding that Plato was not governed by the historical record, can read the Symposium, and ask why the author, Plato, arranged the story the way he did, and what he meant by including the various aspects of setting, composition, characters, and theme, etc.[12][13]\\n\\nSynopsis[edit]\\nA fresco taken from the north wall of the Tomb of the Diver (from Paestum, Italy, c.\\u2009475 BC): a symposium scene\\nFrame story[edit]\\nApollodorus of Phalerum—a passionate follower of Socrates—recounts the story of the symposium to an unnamed friend, having narrated the events to Glaucon while en route home the previous day. The banquet had been hosted by the poet Agathon to celebrate his first victory in a dramatic competition at the Dionysia of 416 BC. Though Apollodorus was not present at the event, which occurred when he was a boy, he heard the story from Aristodemus and confirmed the events with Socrates.\\nThe story, as told by Apollodorus, then moves to the banquet at Agathon\\'s home, where Agathon challenges each of the men to speak in praise of the Greek god, Eros.[13]\\nSocrates is late to arrive because he became lost in thought on the way. When they are finished eating, Eryximachus takes the suggestion made by Phaedrus, that they should all make a speech in praise of Eros, the god of love and desire. It will be a competition of speeches to be judged by Dionysus. It is anticipated that the speeches will ultimately be bested by Socrates, who speaks last.[citation needed]\\n\\nPhaedrus\\' speech[edit]\\nPhaedrus opens with the claim that Eros is the oldest of the gods, citing Hesiod, Acusilaus and Parmenides, and argues that being the oldest implies that the benefits conferred by Eros are the greatest.[14][15] Eros provides guidance through shame; for example, by inspiring a lover to earn the admiration of his beloved into showing bravery on the battlefield, since nothing shames a man more than to be seen by his beloved committing an inglorious act.[16] Lovers sometimes sacrifice their lives for their beloved. As evidence for this, he mentions some mythological heroes and lovers. Even Achilles, who was the beloved of Patroclus, sacrificed himself to avenge his lover, and Alcestis was willing to die for her husband Admetus.[17] Phaedrus concludes his short speech reiterating his statements that love is one of the most ancient gods, the most honored, the most powerful in helping men gain honor and blessedness—and sacrificing one\\'s self for love will result in rewards from the gods.[18]\\n\\nPausanias\\' speech[edit]\\nA terracotta figurine of Aphrodite Urania, c.\\u20093rd century BC. Aphrodite Urania symbolized an elevated, more spiritual love, as opposed to the more earthly and lustful Aphrodite Pandemos.\\nInspired by the cults of Aphrodite Pandemos and Aphrodite Urania, Pausanias—the legal expert of the group—introduces a distinction between vulgar (Πάνδημος) and heavenly (Οὐρανία) love. Vulgar Love is in search of sexual gratification, and his objects are women and boys; Heavenly Love is the pederastic love towards young men (before the age when his beard starts to grow), which produce the benefits described by Phaedrus.[19]\\nPausanias contrasts common desire with a \"heavenly\" love between an older man and a young man, in which the two exchange sexual pleasure while the older man imparts wisdom to the younger one. He distinguishes between this virtuous love, and the love of an older man for a young (immature) boy, which he says should be forbidden on the grounds that love should be based on qualities of intelligence and virtue that are not yet part of a boy\\'s makeup and may not develop.\\nHe then analyses the attitudes of different city-states on homosexuality(the term here refers to pederastic love i.e. love between an older man and a younger man usually in his teens). The first distinction he makes is between the cities that clearly establish what is and what is not admitted, and those that are not so explicitly clear, like Athens. In the first group there are cities favorable to homosexuality, like Elis, Boeotia and Sparta, or unfavorable to it like Ionia and Persia. The case of Athens is analyzed with many examples of what would be acceptable and what would not, and at the end, he makes the assertion that Athens\\' code of behavior favors the nobler type of love and discourages the baser.\\n\\nEryximachus\\' speech[edit]\\nThough it is Aristophanes\\' turn, a bout of hiccups prevent him from speaking, and Eryximachus—the physician—takes his turn, prescribing various hiccup cures in the interim. Eryximachus claims love affects everything in the universe, including plants and animals; once love is attained, it should be protected.[20] Eros not only directs everything on the human plane, but also on the divine. Two forms of love occur in the human body—one is healthy, the other unhealthy (186bc). Love encourages sophrosyne, or soundness of mind and character; He governs medicine, music, and astronomy, and even regulates hot and cold and wet and dry, which—when in balance—result in health (see: Humorism).[21]\\nThroughout Eryximachus\\' speech, Aristophanes tries unsuccessfully to end his hiccoughing fit by holding his breath and gargling with water, until finally sneezing brought about by having his nosed tickled with a feather ends the comic scene.\\n\\nAristophanes\\' speech[edit]\\nAristophanes, who notoriously parodied Socrates in his comedy The Clouds, gives a possibly satirical speech on Eros at the symposium.Before starting his speech, Aristophanes warns the group that his panegyric to love may be more absurd than funny. His speech gives an explanation of why people in love say they feel \"whole\" when they have found their love-partner. He begins by explaining that people must understand human nature before they can interpret the origins of love and how it affects their own times. This is, he says because in primal times people had doubled bodies, with faces and limbs turned away from one another. As spherical creatures who wheeled around like clowns doing cartwheels, these original people were very powerful. There were three sexes: male, female, and hermaphrodite; they were said to have descended from the Sun, the Earth and the Moon, respectively. These creatures tried to scale the heights of Olympus and planned to set upon the gods. Zeus thought about blasting them with thunderbolts, but, not wanting to deprive himself of their devotions and offerings, so he decided to cripple them by chopping them in half, in effect separating each entity\\'s two bodies.[22]\\nEver since that time, people run around saying they are looking for their other half because they are really trying to recover their primal nature. The women who were separated from women run after their own kind—whence lesbians. The men split from other men also run after their own kind and love being embraced by other men. Halves of hermaphroditic wholes are the men and women who engage in heterosexual love. Aristophanes says some people think homosexuals are shameless, but he praises their \"confidence, courage and manliness\": only homosexuals \"prove to be real men in politics,\" and many heterosexuals are adulterous and unfaithful. Aristophanes then claims that when two people who were separated from each other find each other, they never again want to be separated. This feeling is like a riddle, and cannot be explained. Aristophanes ends on a cautionary note. He says that men should fear the gods, and not neglect to worship them, lest they wield the ax again and we have to go about hopping on one leg, split apart once again.[23]\\nThe speech has become a focus of subsequent scholarly debate—it is seen sometimes as mere comic relief, and sometimes as satire: the creation myth Aristophanes puts forward to account for sexuality may be read as poking fun at the myths concerning the origins of humanity, numerous in classical Greek mythology.[citation needed]\\n\\nAgathon\\'s speech[edit]\\nAgathon complains that the previous speakers have made the mistake of congratulating mankind on the blessings of love, failing to give due praise to the god himself: Love, in fact, is the youngest of the gods and is an enemy of old age; Eros shuns the very sight of senility and clings to youth; he is dainty, tiptoeing through the flowers, never settling where there is no \"bud to bloom.\" Agathon also implies that Love is the source of all human virtues: Wisdom, Justice, Courage, and Temperance. Although devoid of philosophical content, the speech Plato puts in the mouth of Agathon is a beautiful formal one, and Agathon contributes to the Platonic love theory with the idea that the object of love is beauty.[24]\\nHis speech may be regarded as self-consciously poetic and rhetorical, composed in the way of the sophists, gently mocked by Socrates.[25][better\\xa0source\\xa0needed]\\n\\nSocrates\\' speech[edit]\\nIn the Symposium, Plato\\'s Socrates attributes his view on love to Diotima, a priestess from Mantinea.\\nBefore Socrates gives his speech he asks some questions of Agathon regarding the nature of love. Socrates then relates a story he was told by a wise woman called Diotima. According to her, Eros is not a god but is a spirit that mediates between humans and their objects of desire. Love itself is not wise or beautiful but is the desire for those things. Love is expressed through propagation and reproduction: either physical love or the exchanging and reproducing of ideas. The greatest knowledge, Diotima says, is knowledge of the \"form of beauty\", which humans must try to achieve. Instead of finding beauty in body like Pausanias and others above had for young boys and youths, one should try to find beauty in soul of others and show Platonic Love. \\nSocrates turns politely to Agathon and, after expressing admiration for his speech, asks whether he could examine his positions further. What follows is a series of questions and answers, typical of Plato\\'s earlier dialogues, featuring Socrates\\' famous method of dialectics. First, he asks Agathon whether it is reasonable for someone to desire what they already have, like for example someone who is in perfect health to wish he were healthy.[26] Agathon agrees with Socrates that this would be irrational, but is quickly reminded of his own definition of Love\\'s true desires: youth and beauty. Putting the two together then, for Love to desire youth he must not have it himself, thus making him old, and for him to desire beauty, he himself must be ugly. Agathon has no choice but to agree.\\nAfter this exchange, Socrates switches to storytelling, a departure from the earlier dialogues where he is mostly heard refuting his opponent\\'s arguments through rational debating.[27] Socrates tells of a conversation he had with Diotima, who plays the same inquiring/instructing role that Socrates played with Agathon.\\nDiotima first explains that Love is neither a god, as was previously claimed by the other guests, nor a mortal but a daemon, a spirit halfway between god and man, who was born during a banquet thrown by the gods to celebrate the birth of Aphrodite. One of the guests was Porus, the god of resource or plenty, who was passed out from drinking too much nectar, and it so happened that another deity arrived, Penia, who came to the banquet to beg, and upon seeing Porus lying unconscious took the chance to sleep with him, conceiving a child in the process: Love. Having been conceived at Aphrodite\\'s birthday party, he became her follower and servant, but through his real origins Love acquired a kind of double nature. From his mother, Love became poor, ugly, and with no place to sleep, while from his father he inherited the knowledge of beauty, as well as the cunningness to pursue it. Being of an intermediary nature, Love is also halfway between wisdom and ignorance, knowing just enough to understand his ignorance and try to overcome it. Beauty then is the perennial philosopher, the \"lover of wisdom\" (the Greek word \"philia\" being one of the four words for love).[28]\\nAfter describing Love\\'s origins, that provide clues to its nature, Diotima asks Socrates why is it, as he had previously agreed, that love is always that \"of beautiful things.\" For if love affects everyone indiscriminately, then why is it that only some appear to pursue beauty throughout their lives? Socrates does not have the answer and so Diotima reveals it: Beauty is not the end but the means to something greater, the achievement of a certain reproduction and birth, the only claim that mortals can have on immortality. This is true for men as well as animals that seek an appropriate place to give birth, preferring to roam in pain until they find it. Some men are pregnant in body alone and, just like animals, enjoy the company of women with whom they can have children that will pass on their existence. Others are pregnant in both body and mind, and instead of children they carry wisdom, virtue, and above all, the art of civic order. Beauty is also their guide, but it will be towards the knowledge needed to accomplish their spiritual births.[29]\\nIn conclusion, Diotima gives Socrates a guide on how a man of this class should be brought up from a young age. First, he should start by loving a particular body he finds beautiful, but as time goes by, he will relax his passion and pass to the love of all bodies. From this point, he will pass to the love of beautiful minds, and then to that of knowledge. Finally, he will reach the ultimate goal, which is to witness beauty in itself, rather than representations, the true Form of Beauty in Platonic terms.[30]\\n\\nAlcibiades\\' speech[edit]\\nThe Drunken Alcibiades Interrupting the Symposium (1648) by Pietro Testa. After the other six speeches have concluded, a drunken Alcibiades crashes the Symposium to give a speech.\\nWhen Socrates is nearly done, Alcibiades crashes in, terribly drunk, and delivers a panegyric to Socrates himself. No matter how hard he has tried, he says, he has never been able to seduce Socrates, because Socrates has no interest in physical pleasure. Despite this speech, Agathon lies down next to Socrates, much to Alcibiades\\' chagrin. Entering upon the scene late and inebriated, Alcibiades pays tribute to Socrates. Like Agathon and Aristophanes, Alcibiades is a historical person from ancient Athens. A year after the events of the Symposium, his political enemies would drive him to flee Athens under fear of being sentenced to death for sacrilege and turn traitor to the Spartans.[31] By his own admission, he is very handsome.\\nFinding himself seated on a couch with Socrates and Agathon, Alcibiades exclaims that Socrates, again, has managed to sit next to the most handsome man in the room. Socrates asks Agathon to protect him from the jealous rage of Alcibiades, asking Alcibiades to forgive him. Wondering why everyone seems sober, Alcibiades is informed of the night\\'s agreement; after Socrates was ending his drunken ramblings, Alcibiades hopes that no one will believe a word Socrates was talking about, Alcibiades proposes to offer a panegyric to Socrates.[32]\\nAlcibiades begins by comparing Socrates to a statue of Silenus; the statue is ugly and hollow, and inside it is full of tiny golden statues of the gods. Alcibiades then compares Socrates to a satyr. Satyrs were often portrayed with the sexual appetite, manners, and features of wild beasts, and often with a large erection. Alcibiades states that when he hears Socrates speak, he feels overwhelmed. The words of Socrates are the only ones to have ever upset him so deeply that his soul started to realize that his aristocratic life was no better than a slave\\'s. Socrates is the only man who has ever made Alcibiades feel shame. Yet all this is the least of it—Alcibiades was intrigued to allow himself to follow Socrates.[33] Most people, he continues, do not know what Socrates is like on the inside:\\n\\nBut once I caught him when he was open like Silenus\\' statues, and I had a glimpse of the figures he keeps hidden within: they were so godlike—so bright and beautiful, so utterly amazing—that I no longer had a choice. I just had to do whatever he told me.—\\u200aSymposium 216e–217a\\nHe was deeply curious towards Socrates\\' intelligence and wisdom, but Alcibiades really wanted him sexually at the time that Socrates, a man that gave only Platonic love to everyone he has encountered, gave up teaching everything he knew towards Alcibiades because of his pride, lust, and immoral conduct upon him. Yet Socrates made no move, and Alcibiades began to pursue Socrates \"as if I were the lover and he my young prey!\" When Socrates continually rebuffed him, Alcibiades began to fantasize a view towards Socrates as the only true and worthy lover he had ever had. So he told Socrates that it seemed to him now that nothing could be more important than becoming the best man he could be, and Socrates was best fit to help him reach that aim. Socrates responded that if he did have this power, why would he exchange his true (inner) beauty for the image of beauty that Alcibiades would provide. Furthermore, Alcibiades was wrong and Socrates knows there is no use in him. Alcibiades spent the night sleeping beside Socrates yet, in his deep humiliation, Alcibiades made no sexual attempt.[34]\\nIn his speech, Alcibiades goes on to describe Socrates\\' virtues, his incomparable valour in battle, his immunity to cold or fear. On one occasion he even saved Alcibiades\\' life and then refused to accept honours for it. Socrates, he concludes, is unique in his ideas and accomplishments, unrivaled by any man from the past or present.[35]\\n\\nPart of a series onPlatonism\\nLife\\nTheory of forms\\nIntelligible form\\nHyperuranion\\nTheory of soul\\nNous\\nThumos\\nPhren\\nEpistemology\\nAnamnesis\\nPeritrope\\nDianoia\\nCardinal virtues\\nMoral rationalism\\nPolitical philosophy\\nMimesis\\nOrthotes onomaton\\nEuthyphro dilemma\\n\\nThe Republic\\nAllegory of the cave\\nAnalogy of the Sun\\nAnalogy of the divided line\\nForm of the Good\\nNoble lie\\nPhilosopher king\\nPlato\\'s number\\nShip of State\\nRing of Gyges\\nMyth of Er\\n\\nTimaeus\\nAtlantis\\nDemiurge\\nWorld soul\\nOrganicism\\nClassical element\\nPlatonic solid\\nTertium quid\\nKhôra\\n\\nRelated articles\\nCommentaries\\nThe Academy in Athens\\nMiddle Platonism\\nNeoplatonism\\nNeoplatonism and Gnosticism\\nNeoplatonism and Christianity\\nPlatonism in Islamic philosophy\\nPlatonism in the Renaissance\\nAllegorical interpretations of Plato\\nPlato\\'s unwritten doctrines\\nPseudo-Platonica\\n\\nRelated categories\\n  Plato\\n\\n Philosophy portalvte\\nConclusion[edit]\\nThe party becomes wild and drunken, with the symposium coming to an end. Many of the main characters take the opportunity to depart and return home. Aristodemus goes to sleep. When he wakes up the next morning and prepares to leave the house, Socrates is still awake, proclaiming to Agathon and Aristophanes that a skillful playwright should be able to write comedy as well as tragedy. When Agathon and Aristophanes fall asleep, Socrates rises up and walks to the Lyceum to wash and tend to his daily business as usual, not going home to sleep until that evening.[36][37][13]\\n\\nInterpretations and themes[edit]\\nAndrew Dalby considers the opening pages of the Symposium the best depiction in any ancient Greek source of the way texts are transmitted by oral tradition without writing.  It shows how an oral text may have no simple origin, and how it can be passed along by repeated tellings, and by different narrators, and how it can be sometimes verified, and sometimes corrupted.[38] The story of the symposium is being told by Apollodorus to his friend.  Apollodorus was not himself at the banquet, but heard the story from Aristodemus, a man who was there.  Also, Apollodorus was able to confirm parts of the story with Socrates himself, who was one of the speakers at the banquet.[39] In addition, the story that Socrates narrates when it is his turn to speak was told to Socrates by Diotima.[13]\\nMartha Nussbaum considers the possibility that the Symposium is intended to criticize Socrates and his philosophy, and to reject certain aspects of his behavior, and that Plato intends to portray Socratic philosophy as something that has lost touch with the actual individual as it devoted itself to abstract principles.[40]\\nJames Arieti considers that the Symposium resembles a drama, with emotional and dramatic events occurring especially when Alcibiades crashes the banquet. Arieti suggests that it should be studied more as a drama, with a focus on character and actions, and less as an exploration of philosophical ideas. This suggests that the characters speak, as in a play, not as the author, but as themselves. This theory, Arieti has found, reveals how much each of the speakers of the Symposium resembles the god, Eros, that they each are describing. It may be Plato\\'s point to suggest that when humankind talks about god, they are drawn towards creating that god in their own image.[41]\\nWalter Hamilton remarks that Plato takes care to portray Alcibiades and Socrates and their relationship in a way that makes it clear that Socrates had not been a bad influence on Alcibiades. Plato does this to free his teacher from the guilt of corrupting the minds of prominent youths, which had, in fact, earned Socrates the death sentence in 399 BC.[13]\\nAristophanes\\' comedy, The Frogs (405 BC), attacks the new tragedy of Agathon and Euripides, and opposes it to the old tragedy of Aeschylus.  In The Frogs, Dionysus, the god of theatre and wine, descends into Hades and observes a heated dispute between Aeschylus and Euripides over who is the best in tragedy.  Dionysus is engaged to be the judge, and decides the outcome, not based on the merits of the two tragedians, but based on their political stance regarding the political figure, Alcibiades.  Since Aeschylus prefers Alcibiades, Dionysus declares Aeschylus the winner. That contest provides the basic structure on which the Symposium is modeled as a kind of sequel:  In the Symposium, Agathon has just celebrated a victory the day before and is now hosting another kind of debate, this time it is between a tragedian, a comic poet, and Socrates.  At the beginning of the Symposium, Agathon asserts that \"Dionysus will be the judge\", and Dionysus is, though Alcibiades performs as a surrogate for the god.  So the character, Alcibiades, who was the deciding factor in the debate in The Frogs, becomes the judge in the Symposium, and he now rules in favor of Socrates, who had been attacked by Aristophanes in The Clouds.  The Symposium is a response to The Frogs, and shows Socrates winning not only over Aristophanes, who was the author of both The Frogs, and The Clouds, but also over the tragic poet who was portrayed in that comedy as the victor.[42][43][44]\\n\\nReception[edit]\\n Votive relief (c.\\u2009420 BC) of a woman holding the liver of a sacrificial victim, probably Diotima of Mantineia\\nThe symposium is considered one of Plato\\'s most important dialogues and is one of the most intensively received. It has had a strong impact both in antiquity and in modern times and is one of the most famous works in world literature.[45]\\n\\nAncient[edit]\\nIn ancient times, the Symposium was read eagerly. From a formal point of view, it became a classic model for the genre of ancient symposia literature. However, later authors did not try to compete with Plato\\'s philosophical depth, but created more loosened up, more entertaining representations, for a wider audience.[46]\\n\\nClassical and Hellenistic period[edit]\\nXenophon, a contemporary of Plato, also wrote a Symposium, which is generally considered to have postdated Plato\\'s work and was modeled after it. For example, in Xenophon\\'s Symposium, Socrates is also a participant in the banquet and gives a speech about Eros.[47]\\nIn his Politics, Aristotle quoted from the speech of Aristophanes in the Symposium.[48]\\nThe Cynic philosopher Bion of Borysthenes (4th-3rd century BC) said that Socrates was a fool if he had sexually desired Alcibiades but had suppressed the drive.[49]\\nThe Epicureans condemned Plato\\'s linking of eroticism with virtue(Arete). According to the Epicurean doctrine, passionate love is highly harmful; the erotic drive is considered a great evil.[50]\\n\\nRoman Empire[edit]\\nDuring the reign of Tiberius in the first century AD, the court astrologer Thrasyllus of Mendes created an influential edition of the works of Plato, where he included the Symposium in his third tetralogy along with the Parmenides, the Philebus, and the Phaedrus. He also gave it the alternate title On the Good, and categorized it as an \"ethical\" writing.[51]\\nIn the first century AD, the Hellenistic Jewish scholar Philo of Alexandria, criticized the homoerotic aspects of the dialogue, claiming that the theme was primarily \"general and vulgar love\" between men or between men and boys, whose moral and social effects were devastating. This criticism was probably not devised by Philo, but taken from an older antiplatonic script.[52][53]\\nThe unknown Middle Platonist author of the commentary on the Theaetetus, which is still partially extant, mentioned in the surviving part of his work that he had previously written a commentary on the Symposium. The lifetime of this Platonist is disputed; the assumptions vary between the 1st century BC and the 2nd century AD.[53]\\nIn his treatise on Isis and Osiris[54] the historian and Platonist philosopher Plutarch offered an allegorical interpretation of Diotima\\'s Eros myth: Eros, who represents the visible world, is born from the combination of a perfect father (Poros), who represents the Platonic world of ideas, with the needy mother (Penia), who is equated with matter. Plutarch\\'s dialogue Amatorius contains numerous reminiscences of the Symposium. In his Table-talk (Quaestiones convivales), Plato\\'s dialogue is clearly recognisable as a model.[55]\\nThe Middle Platonist Lucius Calvenus Taurus taught the Symposium in his philosophy lectures. As his student Aulus Gellius reports, Taurus expressed indignant views about ignorant beginners who wanted to read the dialogue because of the performance of the drunken Alcibiades, instead of being interested in the philosophical content. The role of the Alcibiades apparently rather attracted attention in philosophical circles of the time. This audience wanted to have fun and regarded Plato\\'s work as entertainment.[56][57] Tauros emphasized – as is customary in Platonism – one should pay more attention to the content than to the form, but he also pointed out with pride in the rhetorical brilliance in Pausanias\\' speech; no rhetoric had created such excellent prose as Plato. A passage from this speech particularly impressed Gellius himself, who translated a passage from into Latin and memorized it. He saw it as a pattern of the highest stylistic elegance, which he wanted to recreate in his Latin mother tongue to train his own eloquence.[58][59]\\nThe satirist Lucian of Samosata wrote a Symposium in which he offered a parodic reversal of Plato\\'s concept. As with Plato, Lucian\\'s philosophers hold a banquet, but instead of a meeting with spiritual competition at a high level, there are desolate scenes, the philosophers\\' claim to virtue proves to be hypocrisy.[60] Aelius Aristides emphasized the fictional character of the Platonic dialogues, and pointed to disagreements that he had encountered in the review of individual statements by Plato in Symposium on the basis of historical facts.[61][62] In his Deipnosophistae, Athenaeus criticized the Symposium in the context of his polemic against Plato. He described the dialogue as an empty chatter and claimed that the presentation of Socrates’ military achievements was false, because it did not agree with the reports of other sources,[63] and that report on the night in which Alcibiades wanted to seduce Socrates also could not be true.[64]\\n\\nLate antiquity[edit]\\nIn late antiquity, Neoplatonism was the predominant philosophical system. Plotinus (d. 270), the founder of Neoplatonism, discusses Diotima\\'s concept of Eros in his treatise On Beauty. In his writing On Eros, he interpreted the myth of the origin of Eros allegorically, but he rejected Plutarch\\'s equation of Eros with the visible world.[65] Porphyry of Tyre (died 301/305), one of Plotinus\\' students, tells a story of how Plotinus had attended a public speech by the orator Diophanes, who had defended the behaviour of Alcibiades in the Symposium and stressed the erotic aspect of the relationship between Socrates and Alcibiades, arguing that a philosophy pupil should be prepared to engage in a sexual relationship with his teacher. As a Platonist teacher of philosophy, Plotinus took offense to this portrayal  and commissioned Porphyry to write a response that would be presented to the same audience as Diophanes\\' speech.[66]\\nThe later Neoplatonist Iamblichus (d. around 320/325) taught the Symposium in lessons in his philosophical school for advanced philosophy students, considering it to embody the highest grade in his system of virtues, “contemplative” virtue. He also included the Symposium in his curriculum of the twelve most significant dialogues of Neoplatonism, assigning the Symposium to the “theological” group of dialogues.[67] At the New Academy in Athens, which was founded in the 5th century CE based on the curriculum of Iamblichus, Proclus wrote a commentary on Diotima\\'s remarks in the Symposium, but very little is known about the content of this commentary, as only fragments have survived.[66]\\n\\nMedieval[edit]\\nDuring the Middle Ages, scholars from Western Europe had no access to the text of dialogue. In the Byzantine Empire, on the other hand, the symposium was known; a number of Byzantine manuscripts, some of which are partly provided with scholia, testify to the interest of educated circles in the dialogue. The oldest surviving medieval symposium manuscript originated in one of these; Arethas of Caesarea from the circle of Photios in 895.[92] In the 14th century, the philosopher George Pachymeres made a copy written in his own hand. The extant medieval textual tradition consists of 55 manuscripts which contain the symposium in whole or in part.[68]\\nIn the medieval Islamic world, there is no evidence of any translation of the Symposium, as no direct quotations that purport to be from the dialogue have survived. However, at least parts of the dialogue seem to have been known, including the spherical-man myth, which was widely transmitted in a modified form. A fragment of the lost work entitled The Conformity of Philosophers on the Allegories of Love by the 9th century philosopher al-Kindi seems to contain a relatively detailed summary of Plato\\'s dialogue.[69]\\n\\nRenaissance[edit]\\nThe first edition of the Greek text, Venice 1513\\nIn the West, the Symposium was rediscovered in the age of Renaissance humanism. The Italian humanist and statesman Leonardo Bruni made an incomplete translation into Latin in 1435, which he sent to Cosimo de\\' Medici.[70] The first edition of the Greek text was published in Venice in September 1513 by Aldus Manutius as part of the first complete edition of Plato\\'s works. The editor was Markos Musuros. The arrangement that Musuros gave to the text remained the standard for centuries.[71]\\nThe strongly anti-Platonist humanist George of Trebizond castigated the homoeroticism in Plato\\'s works, the “socratic vice”, in his fighting writing Comparatio philosophorum Plato et Aristotelis. In the Symposium he found a point of attack in  Aristophanes\\' speech, whose erotic concept he interpreted as an affirmation of the satisfaction of sexual greed. The Platonist Bessarion responded to this challenge with a vehement response, the publication of Against Plato\\'s Slanderers in 1469. Bessarion accused Trebizond, among other things, of having equated the views of the various speakers in the symposium with Plato\\'s own position. He sought to show the conformity of the Platonic concept of love with the Christian one. This line of argumentation was groundbreaking for Renaissance Platonism.[72]\\nMarsilio Ficino, an active explorer of ancient Platonism, translated the Symposium into Latin. He published the Latin text in Florence in the complete edition of his Plato translations in 1484, making the dialogue accessible to a wider reading audience. He also wrote a Latin commentary (Commentarium in convivium Platonis de amore, usually called De amore – About Love –) which was also printed in 1484. He gave the comment the figure of a dialogue: a group of scholars gathered in Ficino\\'s villa for a banquet and listens to a reading of the symposium after the meal, then they lay out the speeches about Eros. When commenting on Diotima\\'s teachings, Ficino followed the interpretation of Plotinus. He grabbed Poros as a divine ray of light, Penia as darkness. He also adopted the distinction between heavenly and profane love introduced by Plato\\'s Pausanias. He considered the latter (amor vulgaris) to be a disease. He saw in the Eros concepts of all the speeches of the Symposium aspects of the same Platonic doctrine of love. Ficino also made an Italian (Tuscanian) version of De amore entitled El libro dell’amore, with whom he addressed a broad lay audience. His Symposium commentary contributed significantly to establishing Plato\\'s reputation as the leading theoretician of love. The popular version became the prototype of a series of treatises called love trails (trattati d’amore).[73] The poet Girolamo Benivieni summarized the main ideas of Ficino\\'s Symposium commentary in his poem about love. The humanist Giovanni Pico della Mirandola wrote a commentary on Benivieni\\'s poem in 1486. There he expressed his own understanding of Platonic love.\\nIn 1535, the Dialogues on Love by the Jewish philosopher Judah Leon Abravanel, who was one of the most renowned representatives of Renaissance Platonism, picked up on Plato\\'s art of dialogue in a literary way, but was also strongly influenced by the discussions in the Symposium. His writing was one of the most important formative factors in  love literature of the 16th century.\\nIn France, Queen Margaret of Navarre translated Ficino\\'s commentary into French. The publication of this translation in 1546 gave an important impulse to the reception of the ideas described in the symposium in French poetry. Margaret, who was a poet herself, combined Platonic and Christian elements in her understanding of love. In her epic Les prisons she described an ascent from earthly to divine love. In doing so, she assumed that Diotima\\'s myth of the origin of Eros was familiar with to her readers. Margaret\\'s circle included the poet Antoine Héroet, who addressed the myth of the spherical man in his very popular poem L\\'Androgyne de Plato, printed in 1542.[74]\\nIn the late 16th Century, the philosopher Francesco Patrizi da Cherso wrote L’amorosa filosofia, which imitated the structure of the symposium: the dialogue takes place at a banquet, in which a story is told about a conversation with a woman, in this case the poet Tarquinia Molza, a friend of Patrizi. However, the dialogue also presented unplatonic ideas; it traced all forms of love to a natural drive to self-love. In doing so, Patrizi turned against the tendency to polarize love into a good spiritual and a bad sensual way in the contemporary discourse of love.[75]\\n\\nModern[edit]\\nSocrates with a Disciple and Diotima, by Franz Caucig (1820)\\nThe poet Percy Bysshe Shelley was fascinated by the Symposium, and considered it Plato\\'s most beautiful work. In the summer of 1818 he translated it into English, allowing himself a free translation of the Greek text for style.[76]\\nIn 1845, Søren Kierkegaard published the book Stages on Life\\'s Way, whose first part, entitled In vino veritas, represents a counterpart to Plato\\'s symposium. Kierkegaard constructed his text almost parallel to the ancient model, with a banquet and a succession of speeches about love.[77]\\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, a group of English-speaking poets called themselves the \"Uranians\", referring to the representation of the \"Uranian\" eroticism in Pausanias\\' speech in the Symposium. One theorist of this movement was Edward Perry Warren, who published the novel A Tale of Pausanian Love under the pseudonym Arthur Lyon Raile in 1927 and the three-volume work A Defence of Uranian Love in 1928-1930. Plato\\'s dialogue also plays a role in the novel Maurice by E.M. Forster, written in 1913-1914 and published posthumously only in 1971, Plato\\'s dialogue plays a role in the context of a modern homoerotic relationship. Forster had received the suggestion for the novel from the writer Edward Carpenter, who professed the ideal of an “uranian” love.[78]\\nIn his Beyond the Pleasure Principle (1920), Sigmund Freud cited the spherical-man myth as proof that his theory of the conservative nature of desire had already had a precursor in antiquity. The representation of the Aristophanes in the Symposium is indeed a “hypothesis” of “fantastic kind”, but agree in the basic idea with the acceptance of the regressive character of desire: “It derives a drive from the need for the restoration of an earlier state.”[79] The erotic ascent described in the Symposium has variously been compared with the sublimation in the sense of Freud\\'s psychoanalysis and has been interpreted as a sublimation process, since it leads away from sexual enforcement. However, there are fundamental differences: in sublimation, the libido is suppressed. It is first blocked as a sexual desire and then redirected to other objects, with the substitute objects being less attractive to the subject than the original goal of libido. Even after sublimation, the pursuit of its nature remains sexual. For Plato\\'s Diotima, on the other hand, the ascent never implies a blockage of the erotic impulse, and the forms of eroticism that replace sexual satisfaction are more attractive than these. The Platonic ascent is a consciously accomplished sequence of steps, the sublimation of an unconscious process.[80]\\nSimone Weil interpreted the spherical-man myth in her 1951 publication Intuitions prérétiennes. She considered the state of duality, the separation of subject and object, to be the misfortune of humanity, and said that the division of spherical people was “only a visible picture of this state of duality, which is our essential lack.” To strive for unity as “the state in which subject and object are one and the same, the state of those who recognize himself and love himself.” This goal can be achieved through “alignment with God”.[81]\\nIn 1959, Leo Strauss interpreted the Symposium as a presentation of an examination of the question of whether philosophy or poetry represented the way to wisdom. It is a competition in which Socrates overcome the poets Agathon and Aristophanes, thus showing the reader the superiority of philosophy. This is done in the field of eroticism, a traditional domain of the poets. Thus, the primacy of reason is established over irrational factors. The symposium is the least political among the dialogues of Plato; it is “the natural”, human nature, but also the basis of social and political action.[82]\\nJacques Lacan dealt intensively with Plato\\'s dialogue. He was particularly preoccupied with the relationship between Socrates and Alkibiades, which he looked at from the psychoanalytical point of view of the transmission of affects from one object to another. He asked about the goal of the desire of the Alcibiades. He had transferred his erotic desire, which Agathon actually had been granted, to Socrates, hoping for a counter-transfer, but had refused Socrates. Socrates was in a situation that the psychoanalyst corresponded. In his treatise The Four Basic Concepts of Psychoanalysis (1964), Lacan stated that the transmission was articulated in the symposium “in a perfect and strictest form”. There Plato had gone further than anywhere else in an attempt to show the reader the cominglines of his dialogues. This gave him the most precise way, he displayed the position of the transfer.[83] From this point view, Lacan had already dealt in depth with the symposium in his “achten seminar”, a lecture held in Paris in 1960/1961, which was dedicated to the phenomenon of transmission. He also investigated the state of defect described in the spherical-man myth and the illusionary search of man for his lost half.[84]\\nIn 1984, Michel Foucault, in his History of Sexuality, emphasized the contrast between the conventional and the Platonic understanding of love. For Plato, true love is characterized by the fact that it is related to the truth through the appearances of the object. Thus the love relationship as a relationship to truth is structured. As Foucault points out in more detail, such a love affair differs from a conventional one by the appearance of a new person, the master. He is the one who reflects on himself as a subject of desire, who has the greatest knowledge in love and is therefore the master of truth and teachs the beloved about love. In the conventional game of love, an active lover courts and wins a passive lover for himself; the lover is always the elder of the two, the beloved, the physically more attractive. In Plato, on the other hand, the master of love, an experienced man, becomes an object of love for younger people who far surpass him in physical attractiveness. His power over himself is fascinated and gives him power over others.[85]\\n\\nEditions and translations[edit]\\nProject Gutenberg: Symposium by Plato, trans. by Benjamin Jowett\\nPerseus Project Sym.172a English translation by Harold N.

romanized:\\xa0Rhētorikḗ; Latin: Ars Rhetorica)[1] is an ancient Greek treatise on the art of persuasion, dating from the 4th century\\xa0BCE. The English title varies: typically it is Rhetoric, the Art of Rhetoric, On Rhetoric, or a Treatise on Rhetoric.\\n\\n\\nBackground[edit]\\nAristotle is credited with developing the basics of a system of rhetoric that \"thereafter served as [the] touchstone\" of the discipline,[2] influencing the development of rhetorical theory from ancient through modern times. The Rhetoric is regarded by most rhetoricians as \"the most important single work on persuasion ever written.\"[3] Alan G. Gross and Arthur Walzer concur, indicating that, just as Alfred North Whitehead considered all Western philosophy a footnote to Plato, \"all subsequent rhetorical theory is but a series of responses to issues raised\" by Aristotle\\'s Rhetoric.[4]:\\u200aix–x\\u200a This is largely a reflection of disciplinary divisions, dating back to Peter Ramus\\' attacks on Aristotelian rhetoric in the late 16th century[5] and continuing to the present.[4]:\\u200aix\\u200a\\nLike the other works of Aristotle that have survived from antiquity, the Rhetoric seems not to have been intended for publication, being instead a collection of his students\\' notes in response to his lectures. The treatise shows the development of Aristotle\\'s thought through two different periods while he was in Athens, and illustrates Aristotle\\'s expansion of the study of rhetoric beyond Plato\\'s early criticism of it in the Gorgias (c.\\u2009386\\xa0BCE) as immoral, dangerous, and unworthy of serious study.[6] Plato\\'s final dialogue on rhetoric, the Phaedrus (c.\\u2009370\\xa0BCE), offered a more moderate view of rhetoric, acknowledging its value in the hands of a true philosopher (the \"midwife of the soul\") for \"winning the soul through discourse\". This dialogue offered Aristotle, first a student and then a teacher at Plato\\'s Academy, a more positive starting point for the development of rhetoric as an art worthy of systematic, scientific study.\\nAristotle developed the Rhetoric during two periods when he was in Athens, the first, from 367–347\\xa0BCE (when he was second to Plato in the academy); and the second, from 335–322\\xa0BCE (when he was running his own school, the Lyceum).\\nThe study of rhetoric was contested in classical Greece: on one side were the sophists, and on the other were Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.  The trio saw rhetoric and poetry as tools that were too often used to manipulate others by appealing to emotion and omitting facts. They accused the sophists in particular—including Gorgias and Isocrates—of this sort of manipulation. Plato blamed sophistical rhetoric for the arrest and the death of Socrates. In contrast to the emotional rhetoric and poetry of the sophists was a type of rhetoric grounded in philosophy and the pursuit of enlightenment.\\nAristotle identified rhetoric as one of the three key elements—along with logic and dialectic—of philosophy. The first line of the Rhetoric is: \"Rhetoric is a counterpart (antistrophe) of dialectic.\"[1]:\\u200aI.1.1\\u200a According to Aristotle, logic is concerned with reasoning to reach scientific certainty, while dialectic and rhetoric are concerned with probability and, thus, are the branches of philosophy that are best suited to human affairs. Dialectic is a tool for philosophical debate; it is a means for skilled audiences to test probable knowledge in order to learn. Rhetoric is a tool for practical debate; it is a means for persuading a general audience using probable knowledge to resolve practical issues. Dialectic and rhetoric partner to form a system of persuasion based on knowledge instead of upon manipulation and omission.\\n\\nEnglish translation[edit]\\nMost English readers in the 20th century relied on four translations of the Rhetoric.[citation needed] The first, by Richard C. Jebb, was published in 1909.[7] The next two translations were published in the 1920s. John H. Freese\\'s translation was published as a part of the Loeb Classical Library[8] while W. Rhys Roberts\\' was published as a part of the Oxford University series of works in the Classics.[9] Roberts\\' translation was edited and republished in 1954, and is widely available online.[10] The fourth standard translation, by Lane Cooper, came out in 1932.[11]\\nNot until the 1990s did another major translation of the Rhetoric appear. Published in 1991 and translated by George A. Kennedy, a leading classicist and rhetorician,[12] this work is notable for the precision of its translation and for its extensive commentary, notes, and references to modern scholarship on Aristotle and the Rhetoric. It is generally regarded today as the standard scholarly resource on the Rhetoric.[13]\\nModern translations are still being produced, such as the ones published in 2008 by Joe Sachs[14] and the 2019 one by Robert C. Bartlett.[15]\\n\\nNeo-Aristotelian theory[edit]\\nMain article: Neo-Aristotelianism (rhetorical criticism)\\nRhetorical theory and criticism in the first half of the 20th century was dominated by neo-Aristotelian criticism, the tenets of which were grounded in the Rhetoric and were summed up in 1925 by Herbert Wichelns.[16][further explanation needed] (Forbes I. Hill argues that while Wichelns traditionally gets the credit for summing up neo-Aristotelian theory, Hoyt Hopewell Hudson is more deserving of this credit instead.[17])[importance?] The dominance of neo-Aristotelian criticism was \"virtually unchallenged until the 1960s\" and even now is considered not only as one of many approaches to criticism, but as fundamental for understanding other theoretical and critical approaches which \"developed largely in response to [its] strengths and weaknesses.\"[18]\\n\\nOverview of Book I[edit]\\nThe Rhetoric consists of three books. Book I offers a general overview, presenting the purposes of rhetoric and a working definition; it also offers a detailed discussion of the major contexts and types of rhetoric. Book II discusses in detail the three means of persuasion that an orator must rely on: those grounded in credibility (ethos), in the emotions and psychology of the audience (pathos), and in patterns of reasoning (logos). Book III introduces the elements of style (word choice, metaphor, and sentence structure) and arrangement (organization). Some attention is paid to delivery, but generally the reader is referred to the Poetics for more information in that area.[19]\\nMany chapters in Book I cover typical deliberative argument varieties in Athenian culture.\\n\\nChapter One\\nAristotle says rhetoric is the counterpart (antistrophe) of dialectic.[1]:\\u200aI.1.1–2\\u200a He explains the similarities between the two but fails to comment on the differences. Here he introduces the term enthymeme.[1]:\\u200aI.1.3\\u200a\\nChapter Two\\nAristotle defines rhetoric as the ability in a particular case to see the available means of persuasion. He defines pisteis (plural of πῐ́στῐς, pístis, lit.\\u2009\\'\\'trust in others, faith; means of persuasion\\'\\') as atechnic (inartistic) and entechnic (artistic). Of the pisteis provided through speech there are three: ethos, pathos, and logos. He introduces paradigms and syllogisms as means of persuasion.\\nChapter Three\\nAristotle introduces the three genres of rhetoric: deliberative, forensic, and epideictic rhetoric. He also touches on which \"ends\" the orators in each of these genres hope to reach with their persuasions—which are discussed in further detail in later chapters.[1]:\\u200aI.3.5–7\\u200a Aristotle introduces these three genres by saying that \"[t]he kinds of rhetoric are three in number, corresponding to the three kinds of hearers\".[20]\\nChapter Four\\nAristotle discusses the types of political topics of deliberative rhetoric. The five most common are finance, war and peace, national defense, imports and exports, and the framing of laws.\\nChapter Five\\nAristotle discusses the different ethical topics of deliberative rhetoric. Aristotle identifies the telos (goal) of human action with eudaimonia (\"happiness\" or \"flourishing\") and describes the many factors contributing to it.[1]:\\u200aI.5.5–18\\u200a\\nChapter Six\\nThis explains in greater detail the stoikhea (elements) of the \"good\" described in the previous chapter.\\nChapter Seven\\nIntroduces the term koinon of degree[clarification needed]. Discusses the \"ends\" of deliberative rhetoric in relation to the greater good or more advantageous.\\nChapter Eight\\nAristotle defines and discusses the four forms of politeia useful in deliberative rhetoric: democracy, oligarchy, aristocracy, and monarchy.\\nChapter Nine\\nThis chapter discusses the virtues and concepts of to kalon (the honorable) included in epideictic rhetoric. Aristotle describes what makes certain topics appropriate or worthy for praise or blame. He also states that it is important to highlight certain traits of the subject of praise.\\nChapter Ten\\nAristotle discusses what syllogisms should be derived from kategoria (accusations) and apologia (defenses) for judicial rhetoric. He also introduces the wrongdoing, which is useful for judicial rhetoric.\\nChapter Eleven\\nThis chapter discusses the many different types of hedone (pleasure) useful in judicial rhetoric to describe the motives for people doing wrong.\\nChapter Twelve\\nThis chapter, also about judicial rhetoric, discusses people\\'s dispositions of mind and whom people wrong from motives of hedone discussed in the previous chapter. Aristotle emphasizes the importance of willingness, or intentions, of wrongdoings.\\nChapter Thirteen\\nAristotle classifies all acts that are just and unjust defined in judicial rhetoric. He also distinguishes what kinds of actions are fair and unfair with being just.\\nChapter Fourteen\\nThis chapter parallels the koinon described in chapter Seven. Aristotle clarifies the magnitude in relation to questions[clarification needed] of \"wrongdoing\" meant for judicial rhetoric.\\nChapter Fifteen\\nAristotle summarizes the arguments available to a speaker in dealing with evidence that supports or weakens a case. These atechnic pisteis contain laws, witnesses, contracts, tortures, and oaths.\\nOverview of Book II[edit]\\nBook II gives advice for all types of speeches. Aristotle\\'s Rhetoric generally concentrates on ethos and pathos, and—as noted by Aristotle—both affect judgment. Aristotle refers to the effect of ethos and pathos on an audience since a speaker needs to exhibit these modes of persuasion.\\n\\nChapter 1[edit]\\nIn Chapter 1, Aristotle notes that emotions cause men to change their opinions and judgments. As such, emotions have specific causes and effects.[1]:\\u200aII.1.2–3\\u200a A speaker can therefore employ this understanding to stimulate particular emotions from an audience. However, Aristotle states that along with pathos, the speaker must also exhibit ethos, which for Aristotle encompasses phronesis, arete, and eunoia.[1]:\\u200aII.1.5–9\\u200a\\n\\nChapters 2–11[edit]\\nChapters 2–11 explore those emotions useful to a rhetorical speaker. Aristotle describes how to arouse these emotions in an audience so that a speaker might be able to produce the desired action successfully.[1]:\\u200aII.2.27\\u200a Aristotle arranges the discussion of the emotions in opposing pairs, such as anger and calmness or friendliness and enmity. For each emotion, Aristotle discusses the person\\'s state of mind, against whom one directs the emotion, and for what reasons.[1]:\\u200aII.1.9\\u200a It is pertinent to understand all the components in order to stimulate a certain emotion within another person.\\nFor example, to Aristotle, anger results from the feeling of belittlement.[1]:\\u200aII.2.3–4\\u200a Those who become angry are distressed due to a foiling of their desires.[1]:\\u200aII.2.9\\u200a The angry direct their emotion towards those who insult them or that which those people value. These insults are the reasoning behind the anger.[1]:\\u200aII.2.12–27\\u200a\\nIn this way, Aristotle defines each emotion, assesses the state of mind for those experiencing the emotion, determines to whom people direct the emotion, and reveals their reasoning behind the emotion. The significance of Aristotle\\'s analysis stems from his idea that emotions have logical grounding and material sources.\\n\\nChapters 12–17[edit]\\nGeorge A. Kennedy in a note to On Rhetoric: A Theory of Civic Discourse remarks that ethos predominantly refers to the \"moral character\" of actions and mind. Kennedy reveals the purpose of chapters 12–17 as a demonstration to the speaker of \"how his ethos must attend and adjust to the ethos of varied types of auditor if he is to address them successfully.\"[12]:\\u200a148\\u200a As seen in the chapters explaining the various emotions, in chapters 12–17 Aristotle focuses on the necessary means of successfully persuading an audience. Yet, in these[ambiguous] chapters, Aristotle analyzes the character of different groups of people so that a speaker might adjust his portrayed ethos in order to influence the audience.\\nFirst, he describes the young as creatures of desire, easily changeable and swiftly satisfied. The young hate to be belittled because they long for superiority.[1]:\\u200aII.12.1–15\\u200a According to Aristotle, the old are distrustful, cynical, and small-minded, for unlike the young their past is long and their future short.[1]:\\u200aII.13.1–5\\u200a The old do not act on desire but rather act for profit.[1]:\\u200aII.13.13–14\\u200a Those in the prime of life represent the mean to Aristotle, possessing the advantages of both old and young without excess or deficiency.[1]:\\u200aII.14.1\\u200a One of good birth, wealth, or power has the character of a lucky fool, a character in which insolence and arrogance breed if these good fortunes are not used to one\\'s advantage.[1]:\\u200aII.15–17\\u200a\\n\\nChapters 18–26[edit]\\nAlthough Book II primarily focuses on ethos and pathos, Aristotle discusses paradigm and enthymeme as two common modes of persuasion. There are two kinds of paradigm: comparisons, referencing that which has happened before; and fables, inventing an illustration.[1]:\\u200aII.20.2–3\\u200a Maxims, or succinct, clever statements about actions, serve as the conclusion of enthymemes.[1]:\\u200aII.1–2\\u200a In choosing a maxim, one should assess the audience views and employ a fitting maxim.[1]:\\u200aII.21.15–16\\u200a Amplification and deprecation, although not elements of an enthymeme, can contribute to refuting an opponent\\'s enthymeme or revealing a falsehood by exposing it as just or unjust, good or evil, etc. Aristotle also mentions the koina, fallacious enthymemes, and lysis (the refutation of an opponent\\'s enthymeme). In all of these techniques, Aristotle considers popular wisdom and audiences as a central guide. Thus, the speaker\\'s effect on the audience serves as a key theme throughout Book II.\\nBook II ends with a transition to Book III. The transition concludes the discussion of pathos, ethos, paradigms, enthymemes, and maxims so that Book III may focus on delivery, style, and arrangement.\\n\\nOverview of Book III[edit]\\nBook III of Aristotle\\'s Rhetoric is often overshadowed by the first two books. While Books I and II are more systematic and address ethos, logos, and pathos, Book III is often considered a conglomeration of Greek stylistic devices on rhetoric. However, Book III contains informative material on lexis (style) which refers to the \"way of saying\"[1]:\\u200aIII.1–12\\u200a and taxis, which refers to the arrangement of words.[1]:\\u200aIII.13–19\\u200a\\n\\nChapters 1–12: style (lexis)[edit]\\nChapter 1\\nSummarizes Book I and Book II and introduces the term hypokrisis (pronuntiatio). Aristotle argues that voice should be used to most accurately represent the given situation as exemplified by poets.[1]:\\u200aIII.1:3–4\\u200a\\nChapter 2\\nHighlights aretê, which is defined as virtue or excellence. When applied to rhetoric, aretê means natural rather than forced or artificial.[1]:\\u200aIII.2:1-4\\u200a Metaphors are also addressed as a skill that cannot be taught and that should bestow \"verbal beauty\".[1]:\\u200aIII.2:6–13\\u200a\\nChapter 3\\nDeals with \"frigid\" language. This occurs when one uses elaborate double words, archaic and rare words, added descriptive words or phrases, and inappropriate metaphors.[1]:\\u200aIII.3:1–4\\u200a\\nChapter 4\\nDiscusses another figurative part of speech, the simile (also known as an eikon). Similes are only occasionally useful in speech due to their poetic nature and similarity to metaphor.\\nChapter 5\\nAddresses how to speak properly by using connectives, calling things by their specific name, avoiding terms with ambiguous meanings, observing the gender of nouns, and correctly using singular and plural words.[1]:\\u200aIII.5:1–6\\u200a\\nChapter 6\\nGives practical advice on how to amplify language by using onkos (expansiveness) and syntomia (conciseness). Not using the term circle, but giving its definition, would exemplify onkos, and using the word as the definition would exemplify syntomia.[1]:\\u200aIII.5:1–3\\u200a\\nChapter 7\\nAristotle expands on the use of appropriate style in addressing the subject. \"Lexis will be appropriate if it expresses emotion and character and is proportional to the subject matter\". Aristotle stresses emotion, credibility, genus (like age), and moral state as important considerations.[1]:\\u200aIII.7:1–6\\u200a\\nChapter 8\\nRhythm should be incorporated into prose to make it well \"rhythmed\" but not to the extent of a poem.[1]:\\u200aIII.8:3–7\\u200a\\nChapter 9\\nLooks at periodic style and how it should be seen as a rhythmical unit and used to complete a thought to help understand meaning.[1]:\\u200aIII.9:3–4\\u200a\\nChapter 10\\nAristotle further highlights the metaphor and addresses how it brings about learning and enables visualization[1]:\\u200aIII.10:1–6\\u200a\\nChapter 11\\nExplains why devices of style can defamiliarize language. Aristotle warns that it is inappropriate to speak in hyperbole.[1]:\\u200aIII.11:15\\u200a\\nChapter 12\\nThe three genres of oral and written language are deliberative, judicial, and epideictic, all of which are written by logographoi (speech writers) who are each skilled at different types of speeches. This transitions into the next set of chapters on taxis.\\nChapters 13–19: parts of speech[edit]\\nChapter 13\\nCovers the necessary parts of a speech which include the prosthesis (which is the statement of the proposition) and then the pistis (which is the proof of the statement), along with the prooemium (introduction) and epilogue.[1]:\\u200aIII.13:1–4\\u200a\\nChapter 14\\nDiscusses the prooemiun, which demonstrates how the introduction should be used in both epideictic and judicial speeches. Both have the main goal of signaling the end of the speech.[1]:\\u200aIII.14:1–11\\u200a\\nChapter 15\\nHandles prejudicial attacks according to Aristotle which later on became part of stasis which is \"determining the question at issue in a trial\".\\nChapter 16\\nDiēgēsis or narration is discussed and how one must work through an argument by using logos. Narration differs between epideictic, judicial, and deliberative narratives.\\nChapter 17\\nLooks at the pistis or the proof in an oration, and how it varies in each type of speech.\\nChapter 18\\nErotēsis, also known as interrogation, referred to asking and demanding responses in trials during Aristotle\\'s time. It is \"most opportune when an opponent has said one thing and when if the right question is asked, an absurdity results\".[1]:\\u200aIII.19:1\\u200a\\nChapter 19\\nEpilogues are the conclusion of speeches and must include four things: \"disposing the hearer favorably toward the speaker and unfavorably to the opponent, amplifying and minimizing, moving the hearer into emotional reactions, and giving reminder of the speech\\'s main points\".[1]:\\u200aIII.19:1–4\\u200a\\nScholars turn to Book III to develop theories about Greek style and its contemporary relevance.[21]\\n\\n\\nReception[edit]\\nMartin Heidegger praises the work in Being and Time as \"the first systematic hermeneutic of the everydayness of Being with one another\".[22]\\n\\nImportance of deliberative rhetoric[edit]\\nAmélie Oksenberg Rorty discusses the structure and characteristics of deliberative rhetoric in her research. She cites Aristotle to persuade her audience of the characteristics of deliberative rhetoric\\'s influential nature. \"Aristotle marks as central to deliberative rhetoric: considerations of prudence and justice, the projected political and psychological consequences of the decision and the likelihood of encouraging—or entrenching—similar rebellious attitudes amongst allies.\"[23] The outstanding characteristic of deliberative rhetoric is practicality, Rorty argues: \"the deliberative rhetorician who wishes to retain his reputation as trustworthy must pay attention to what is, in fact, actually likely to happen.\"[23] Additionally, Aristotle focuses on deliberative rhetoric so heavily because \"it most clearly reveals the primary importance of truth as it functions within the craft of rhetoric itself.\"[23] A path to action is determined through deliberative rhetoric, since an individual following practical means is likely to foresee likely events and act accordingly.\\nIn interpreting Aristotle\\'s work on use of rhetoric, Bernard Yack discusses the vast need for public discourse and public reasoning.  He states: \"We deliberate together in political communities by making and listening to each other\\'s attempts to persuade us that some future action will best serve the end that citizens share with each other... It is this shared goal that distinguishes deliberative rhetoric, and therefore public reasoning, from the other forms of rhetoric and political judgment that Aristotle examines.\"[24] Shared goals are of utmost importance when deliberating on an issue that affects the common good. Without such a version of deliberative rhetoric, arguments would unfairly favor the interests of power and neglect the rights of the common people.\\n\\nSee also[edit]\\nEnthymeme\\nThe Art of Being Right\\nContra principia negantem disputari non potest\\nWar from the Ground Up, book partially based on Aristotle\\'s Rhetoric\\nReferences[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z aa ab ac ad ae af ag ah ai aj ak al Aristotle.

This\\nversion is typeset by the authors and differs only in pagination and typographical detail.\\n1. Introduction\\nThe rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) applications has led to increased attention\\nto Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technologies, such as LoRa Wide Area Network\\n(LoRaWAN), which provide long-range communication with low power consumption [1]. Lo-\\nRaWAN networks are particularly appealing for rural areas, where infrastructure constraints\\ncan pose significant challenges to traditional wireless communication systems [2]. In this con-\\ntext, the integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as mobile relays has emerged as a\\npromising solution, enabling flexible deployments and extended coverage [3]. Determining the\\nUAV position that minimizes signal propagation loss and assessing the corresponding received\\npower are critical for ensuring reliable connectivity and resource-efficient operations in these\\nrural scenarios [4].\\nParallel to these developments in wireless communications, Large Language Models (LLMs)\\nhave shown rapid progress.\\nModern LLMs—including GPT-4 [5], recent open-source offer-\\nings locally installable with Ollama [6], and novel models such as DeepSeek [7]—have shown\\nsubstantial capabilities in understanding complex tasks and generating functional code for en-\\ngineering problems [5]. Furthermore, these models demonstrate a broad applicability beyond\\ncode generation, including text clustering [8], text summarization [9], machine translation [10],\\n1\\narXiv:2502.14926v3  [cs.SE]  7 Apr 2025\\nand text classification/question answering [11]. However, despite these advancements, the ef-\\nfectiveness of lightweight, locally executed models in generating correct and efficient solutions\\nfor domain-specific engineering tasks remains an open question [12].\\nThis study investigates whether lightweight and locally executed LLMs can generate correct\\nPython code for UAV planning tasks in LoRaWAN environments. Specifically, we assess 16\\ndifferent LLMs by evaluating their ability to generate Python functions that determine the\\noptimal UAV position from a discrete set of candidate locations, minimizing propagation loss,\\nand computing the corresponding received power (in dBm). Our primary goal is to compare the\\nperformance of locally run models, such as LLaMA-3.3 [13] and Phi-4 [14], against state-of-the-\\nart large models such as GPT-4 [5] and DeepSeek-V3 [7], accessed via their online application\\nprogramming interfaces (APIs). The inclusion of these larger models serves as a reference point\\nto establish that such tasks can indeed be solved using advanced LLMs, allowing for a meaning-\\nful comparison with the performance of smaller, locally executed alternatives. The evaluation\\nuses a zero-shot natural language prompt configuration, and correctness is measured through\\na scoring system based on function extraction and execution results.\\nDespite significant progress in AI-assisted UAV deployment, previous research has largely\\noverlooked the unique communication and operational constraints inherent to LoRaWAN envi-\\nronments. LoRaWAN deployments pose distinct challenges such as stringent power limitations,\\nspecialized propagation characteristics at lower frequencies, and long-range communication re-\\nquirements that differ fundamentally from scenarios commonly studied in existing UAV-AI\\nliterature. Existing approaches primarily focus on UAV trajectory planning, mission coordina-\\ntion, or visual scene understanding tasks, without explicitly addressing scenarios involving the\\nlow-power, wide-area network constraints and signal propagation peculiarities of LoRaWAN sys-\\ntems. This gap motivates our study, which specifically examines whether LLMs—particularly\\nlightweight, locally executable variants—can effectively generate Python code to solve UAV\\nplacement and received power calculation tasks uniquely relevant to LoRaWAN environments.\\nThe findings of this study are significant for two main reasons. First, they illustrate the\\nextent to which lightweight, locally run LLMs can perform domain-specific engineering tasks,\\nproviding insight into their potential as cost-effective alternatives to proprietary, large-scale\\nmodels [15].\\nSecond, these findings may offer practical guidance not only for practitioners\\nintegrating LLM-generated code into IoT and UAV communication workflows but also for\\nthose in a wide range of other fields, as they highlight critical considerations such as reliability,\\ncorrectness, and maintainability. The subsequent sections of this paper are organized as follows.\\nSection 2 provides background information on the use of LLMs for human–UAV interaction\\nand code generation, also discussing relevant aspects of prompt design. Section 3 describes the\\nmaterials and methods employed, including the engineering problem context, prompt structure,\\nmodel selection, and evaluation metrics.\\nResults are presented in Section 4, followed by a\\ndetailed discussion in Section 5. Section 6 outlines the study’s limitations and opportunities for\\nfuture research. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper with final remarks and recommendations.\\n2. Background\\nIn this section, we start by addressing the general goal of integrating LLMs with UAVs to\\nimprove the behavior, organization, and communication of autonomous systems, as well as the\\nspecific implementation of UAVs as mobile relays and antennas in LoRoWAN environments.\\nIn Section 2.2, we focus on the specific task of generating code for autonomous devices and\\non how LLMs are being used to incorporate code generation at different levels of workflow.\\nFinally, in Section 2.3, we briefly discuss prompt engineering and its principles, the benefits\\nand drawbacks of conversational and structured prompting, and how prompt design impacts\\ncode generation or task planning.\\n2\\n2.1. LLMs for Human–UAV Interaction\\nThe nature of UAVs, namely their collective organization and communication requirements,\\nstrongly encourages integration with Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms. The recent emer-\\ngence of LLM technologies in particular is inspiring new frameworks and prototypes for com-\\nmunication and design of several autonomous systems, and UAVs are no exception. As LLMs\\nlearning and adaptation capabilities in uncertain and dynamic environments grow and approach\\nhuman-level proficiency, the scientific literature on the subject steadily increases [16, 17]. Cur-\\nrently, there is a significant amount of knowledge on LLMs for human–UAV interaction. For a\\nreview on the state-of-the art literature on LLMs and UAVs, please refer to [16]. For a discus-\\nsion of key areas where LLMs can impact UAVs, we urge the reader to refer to the paper by\\nPhadke et al. [17]. In the following paragraphs, we discuss some recent developments on the\\nusage of natural language models for controlling UAVs.\\nIn [18], Aikins et al. present LEVIOSA, a framework for the generation of UAV trajectory\\nbased on text and speech. The authors use several LLMs to convert natural language prompts\\ninto sets of coordinates to guide the UAVs and low-level controllers to control each device in\\nits path, aiming for accuracy, synchronization, and collision avoidance. LEVIOSA was tested\\non various scenarios with promising results.\\nCui et al. [19] propose a Task Planning for Multi-UAV System (TPML) that uses LLMs\\nas interfaces to translate UAV’s operator instructions into executable codes. After validating\\nthe system in simulation environments and real-wold scenarios, the authors argue that TPML\\nis able to control multiple UAVs in both synchronous and asynchronous missions with a single\\nnatural language input.\\nWhile most of the studies on natural language processing for UAVs focus on processing the\\nuser messages to program or optimize UAV behavior, others try to provide UVAs with scene\\ndescriptions skills in natural language, taking advantage of their capacity to acquire visual cues\\nof the environment. In [20], the authors use LLMs and Visual Language Models (VLMs) to\\nprovide UAVs with the ability of scene description using natural language. The generated tests\\nwere subject to a readability test, some achieving a high school senior reading level (level 12 in\\nthe Gunning fog index).\\nIn [21], the authors discuss a framework that integrates a novel factorization method—\\nQTRAN—in a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm (MARL) [22] with an LLM to\\noptimize UAV trajectories, overcoming limitations of value decomposition algorithms for tra-\\njectory planning, as they have difficulties in associating local observations with the global state\\nof UAV swarms. Although QTRAN overcomes some of the limitations of standard MARLs, its\\nperformance can still be improved, namely by enhancing the representation network. For that\\npurpose, the authors incorporate LLMs in the framework, boosting its overall performance in\\ntrajectory optimization and outperforming other reinforcement learning methods.\\nLPWAN-based systems are one of the emerging technologies in which UAVs are being tested\\nand deployed. LPWANS, and LoROWANs in particular, rely on a set of fixed sensor stations,\\nwhich measure and transmit a number of environmental data to a central unit. Traditionally,\\nthese stations are static, cover only very small areas and can be impaired by natural disasters.\\nDue to their mobility, UAVs can act as moving communication nodes, which solves some of the\\nlimitations of static LoROWANs.\\nSeveral methods have been proposed to integrate UAVs in LoROWANs.\\nIn [23], UAVs\\nare used to transfer information from ground-based LORAWAN nodes to the base station.\\nThe architecture of the systems thus consists of two layers, the first being the ground nodes that\\ntransmit data using LoRaWAN and the second the swarm of drones communicating over a WiFi\\nad hoc network. To enhance the performance of the systems, a distributed topology algorithm\\nperiodically adapts the UAV topology to the position of the ground nodes. In [24], the authors\\n3\\ndescribe an air quality monitor system based on a LORAWAN and UAVs. In [25], a UAV\\nemergency monitoring system using a LORAWAN is proposed to overcome the limitations of\\nground stations in disaster scenarios. Finally, Arroyo et al. [26] propose a UAV and LOROWAN\\nsystem that enables data transfer from sensors to a central system and then use machine learning\\nto classify the data. To the extent of our knowledge, there are no studies on the integration of\\nLLMs and UAVs in a LoRaWAN environment.\\n2.2. Code Generation with LLMs\\nThe landscape of AI-assisted programming has evolved significantly, with extensive research\\nfocusing on natural language generation and understanding of large codebases [27]. Shortly after\\ntheir inception, some LLMs demonstrated capabilities in code assistance and code generation,\\neven from natural language specifications.\\nIn the first models, those skills were somewhat\\nlimited and the output often required post-processing steps to improve the quality of the sug-\\ngested code [28]. But LLMs quickly evolved, and their ability to provide executable code in\\ndue time improved significantly [29]. Furthermore, derivations of popular LLMs, like Open\\nAI Codex [30], a descendant of ChatGPT-3, and Code Llama [13], Meta’s programming tool,\\nemerged as specialized models for coding. Nowadays, AI-assisted programming is a common\\npractice in industry.\\nIn the context of code generation for autonomous devices, Vemprala et al. [31] explore Chat-\\nGPT’s ability on several robot-oriented tasks, including code synthesis. The authors present a\\nframework for robot control that requires designing and implementing a library of APIs recep-\\ntive to prompt engineering for ChatGPT. The proposed framework allows the generated code\\nto be tested, verified, and validated by a user through simulation and manual inspection.\\nIn [32], the authors adapt LLMs trained on code completion for writing robot policy code\\naccording to natural language prompts. The generated robot policies exhibit spatial-geometric\\nreasoning and are able to prescribe precise values to ambiguous descriptions. By relying on a\\nhierarchical prompting strategy, their approach is able to write more complex code and solve\\n39.8% of the problems on the HumanEval [30] benchmark.\\nLuo et al. [33] use LLMs to generate robot control programs, testing and optimizing the\\noutput in a simulation environment. After a number of optimization rounds, the robot control\\ncodes are deployed on a real robot for construction assembly tasks. The experiments show\\nthat their approach can improve the quality of the generated code, thus simplifying the robot\\ncontrol process and facilitating the automation of construction tasks.\\n2.3. Prompt Design\\nThe piece of text or set of instructions that the user provides to an LLM to generate a\\nspecific response is called a prompt. Designing effective prompts is essential to take advantage\\nof the potential of LLMs, and in a few years the craft established as a field of research and\\ndevelopment of its own [34].\\nPrompting strategies can be broadly classified into structured and unstructured approaches.\\nStructured prompting employs precise instructions with explicitly defined inputs, outputs,\\nand constraints, often leading to more reliable and accurate code generation. However, struc-\\ntured prompts typically require a deeper understanding of both the problem domain and the\\nunderlying model, potentially limiting flexibility and accessibility. Conversely, unstructured\\nprompting uses intuitive, conversational language, making it accessible to a broader audience,\\nreflecting realistic scenarios where users may not possess specialized knowledge of prompt craft-\\ning. However, this can result in less consistent outputs due to inherent ambiguity.\\nPrompts may also be categorized based on the number of illustrative examples provided:\\nzero-shot prompts provide no examples, one-shot prompts include a single example, and few-\\n4\\nshot prompts incorporate multiple examples. Empirical research supports the trade-offs asso-\\nciated with different prompt styles; for instance, Liang et al. [32] demonstrate that structured,\\ncode-based prompts generally yield superior results for robot-related reasoning tasks compared\\nto natural language prompts. However, advances in LLM technology continue to improve the\\nviability of unstructured, natural language prompting in complex domains such as robotics [31].\\nFurther improvements in output coherence have also been observed through structured reason-\\ning techniques such as chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting [35, 33].\\nIn this study, we follow a natural language zero-shot prompt strategy, in which the request is\\nperformed in a relatively unstructured fashion without any examples. Nonetheless, established\\nbest practices for engineering-focused code generation were followed by explicitly specifying\\nfunction inputs, expected return types, and required libraries, thus improving the clarity and\\nreproducibility of the generated code [36].\\n3. Materials and Methods\\nThis section starts with an overview of the theoretical context that informs our prompt\\ndesign in Section 3.1. Next, Section 3.2 presents the proposed prompts and their respective\\nscenarios. Section 3.3 describes and justifies the models analyzed in this study. Section 3.4\\nthen outlines the prompting and response processing pipeline. The section concludes with a\\ndescription of the experimental setup in Section 3.5, including all tested inputs for both the\\nLLMs and the generated Python functions, the expected function results, and the evaluation\\nmetrics used.\\n3.1. Theoretical Context\\nThe IoT paradigm refers to the interconnection of physical devices that collect, exchange,\\nand process data over the Internet or other communication networks. According to Sanguesa et al. [37],\\nit is estimated that by 2030, there will be approximately 125 billion IoT devices, ranging from\\nsimple temperature and humidity sensors to more complex sensors used in sectors such as agri-\\nculture and industry. The main goal of these sensors is to simplify and optimize daily activities.\\nOne of the challenges associated with this paradigm is the large volume of data generated and\\nhow it is processed. A potential solution for data collection is the use of UAVs, which can\\nfly over (or carry) multiple sensors along a predefined path planning. These UAVs may or\\nmay not be capable of transmitting data in real time to a base station (BS). However, to use\\nUAVs efficiently, it is often necessary to calculate their location and send control commands\\nto adjust their position or even modify their flight path. Therefore, reliable communication\\nbetween the UAV and a base station is crucial. One possible communication protocol for this\\npurpose is LoRaWAN, which is based on LoRa (long-range) communication and enables ef-\\nfective long-distance data transmission [38, 39]. Essentially, LoRa communication establishes\\na link between two points: the transmitter—in this case, the BS—and the receiver, i.e., the\\nUAV. This communication is based on classical propagation models, such as those found in\\nreference [40].\\nRegarding the modulation of a communication channel, the received power at the antenna\\n(pr) depends on factors such as the transmit power (pt), the gain of the antennas (gr and gt),\\nthe distance between the antennas (r), and the losses during transmission (free-space attenua-\\ntion). Equation (1) represents the propagation loss lF between the two points:\\nlF = pt · gr · gt\\npr\\n=\\n\\x124πr\\nλ\\n\\x132\\n=\\n\\x124πrf\\nc\\n\\x132\\n(1)\\nwhere λ represents the wavelength. In particular, λ = c\\nf , with c representing the speed of light\\nand f the frequency, which in Europe is 868 MHz.\\n5\\nA lower propagation loss results in a stronger received signal. Propagation losses are typi-\\ncally expressed in dB units, and for a distance in meters and a frequency in Hz, Equation (1)\\ncan be rewritten as Equation (2), which represents the Free Space Path Loss formula. This\\nformula is valid under free-space conditions, assuming a direct, unobstructed line of sight.\\nIn terms of notation, lowercase variables denote linear values, whereas uppercase variables\\ndenote logarithmic values.\\nLF(dB) = 20 log(rm) + 20 log(fHz) −147.55\\n(2)\\nTo estimate the received power, it is necessary to consider the transmitted power, the gain\\nof the transmitting and receiving antennas, and the path losses that occur during transmission.\\nThus, Equation (3), derived from Equation (1), can be written as\\nPr(dBm) = Pt + Gt + Gr −LF\\n(3)\\n3.2. Scenarios and Prompts\\nTo evaluate the LLM models, three zero-shot prompts with increasing levels of difficulty\\nwere designed—see Table 1. In this context, ‘zero-shot’ refers to prompts that do not provide\\nany examples to the model being tested. Furthermore, these prompts use natural language,\\nmeaning that they are relatively unstructured and have undergone minimal refinement, apart\\nfrom ensuring technical precision and clarity. This approach was chosen as it more closely\\nfollows real-world scenarios where domain experts may rely on direct, straightforward queries\\nto achieve their goals.\\nThe specific request posed by these prompts is for the LLM to identify, from a set of points,\\nthe point where the value of LF is the lowest or to determine the received power at that point\\n(i.e., the point with the lowest LF). In all scenarios, a frequency of 868 MHz is considered,\\nas well as a rural area where LoRa communication is possible up to 10 km. Both antennas are\\nassumed to have a gain of 2.5 dBi each.\\nTo simplify post-processing of responses, all prompts specify the available libraries, the ex-\\npected indentation type, and that the return function should be self-contained—i.e., all required\\ncode including constants and auxiliary functions should be defined within the requested func-\\ntion.\\nThe first prompt is presented in the first row of Table 1. In this simpler scenario, the BS\\nand the UAV’s possible positions, measured in kilometers (km), are defined within a coordinate\\nsystem with two axes: the x-axis and the y-axis. The BS is fixed at position (0, 0), while the\\nUAV’s possible positions are provided as an input array to the function generated by the LLMs.\\nTo solve this problem, LLMs must generate a Python function that calculates the distance (e.g.,\\nEuclidean) between the BS and each possible UAV position, applies Equation (2) to compute\\npower losses, and returns the index of the position with the lowest loss. The LLM must ensure\\nthat power losses maintain a one-to-one correspondence with the UAV positions to return the\\ncorrect index.\\nPrompt 2, shown in the second row of Table 1, increases the complexity by considering\\ngeographical coordinates—latitude and longitude—instead of a simple (x, y) axis. LLMs must\\nuse a different method to calculate the distances between the UAV’s position and the BS, such\\nas Haversine’s formula. This prompt further increases the difficulty by requiring that the UAV’s\\nposition be given as the first element of the input array. Consequently, the generated functions\\nmust extract this information and return an index greater than zero, as index zero contains the\\nUAV’s position.\\nPrompt 3, presented in the last row of Table 1, closely resembles Prompt 2.\\nHowever,\\ninstead of returning the index with the lowest loss, the generated function must return the\\nvalue of that loss by applying Equation (3).\\n6\\nTable 1: Prompts designed for this study, requiring the tested LLMs to generate Python functions that solve\\nincreasingly complex tasks related to LoRaWAN and UAVs.\\nPrompt 1\\nConsider that the LoRaWAN communication protocol is being used in a rural scenario where a base station communicates with\\na UAV at a communication frequency of 868 MHz.

Also, assume that all positions are in kilometers (km).\\nCreate a Python function called `index_position()` which accepts a list of tuples, with each (x, y) tuple representing a\\npossible position in which the UAV can be placed with respect to the base station.

LLMs Considered\\nThe LLMs models used in this paper were chosen based on their impact in AI research, in-\\nnovative approaches, and performance across different domains such as programming, advanced\\nreasoning, and computational efficiency. Table 2 lists and characterizes the LLMs selected for\\nthis study. For the remainder of this paper, the number of parameters associated with each\\nmodel is expressed in billions or trillions with an uppercase B and T, respectively.\\nThe DeepSeek family of models includes a range of architectures designed to balance perfor-\\nmance and computational efficiency. DeepSeek-R1 (7B) and DeepSeek-R1 (70B) are distilled\\nversions derived from the larger DeepSeek-R1 model (671B)—based on the Qwen and LLaMA\\narchitectures—to retain significant reasoning capabilities while reducing hardware demands [41].\\nIn contrast, DeepSeek-V3 (671B) is a Mixture-of-Experts model designed to perform well in di-\\nverse tasks [7]. Considering these models is crucial due to their varied architectures and training\\nmethodologies, which offer insights into the trade-offs between model size, training techniques,\\nand task-specific performance. The V3 671B model was selected over its more developed R1\\ncounterpart, as initial trials demonstrated it was sufficiently accurate for the prompts presented\\nin Section 3.2, providing a balance between performance and cost.\\nThe Gemma model family [42, 43], developed by Google DeepMind, comprises open mod-\\nels derived from the research and technology behind the Gemini models. While influenced by\\n8\\nGemini, Gemma is fully open-source and designed for efficient language understanding and\\nreasoning. The lightweight Gemma v1.1 (2B) and Gemma2 (2B) implementations are opti-\\nmized for resource-limited environments. Gemma2 (2B) incorporates knowledge distillation,\\nimproving efficiency and performance relative to its size. These models were included to assess\\nthe trade-offs in model scaling, particularly for the real-time and cost-sensitive applications\\nassociated with the tested prompts.\\nOpenAI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models are proprietary LLMs de-\\nsigned to understand and generate human-like text, facilitating tasks such as drafting docu-\\nments, coding, and responding to queries [5]. Their popularity and advanced capabilities make\\nthem essential subjects in LLM comparison studies. In this context, GPT-4-0613 was selected\\nover newer models such as GPT-4o and o1, as preliminary tests indicated its performance was\\nsufficient for the presented prompts, therefore reducing costs.\\nThe LLaMA series by Meta AI includes models optimized for various applications [13].\\nLLaMA-3.2 (3B) is a lightweight, multilingual model suited for mobile and edge devices, ap-\\npropriate for text summarization and classification. LLaMA-3.3 (70B) is a larger, instruction-\\ntuned model with superior performance in natural conversation and multilingual tasks. Code\\nLlama (7B) specializes in code generation and understanding. Testing these three models is\\nimportant for evaluating how model size, specialization, and efficiency in the LLaMA family\\nimpacts performance across the three implemented prompts.\\nThe Mistral family of language models [44], developed by the French company Mistral AI,\\nstands out for its efficient architecture and strong performance. Mistral models achieve high\\naccuracy with fewer parameters, making them more accessible and computationally efficient\\ncompared to many large-scale models. The Mistral v0.3 (7B) model exemplifies this approach,\\ndemonstrating capabilities in text and code generation, conversation, and function calling, while\\neffectively handling longer sequences. Its open-source nature offers a valuable option for research\\nand application development, providing a European alternative to models predominantly from\\nU.S.- and China-based companies.\\nThe Phi model family [14], developed by Microsoft Research, is focused on the role of high-\\nquality synthetic data for improving reasoning in compact language models. Phi-4, a 14-billion\\nparameter model, prioritizes synthetic data to improve problem-solving in mathematics and\\ncoding, outperforming its teacher model, GPT-4, on several benchmarks. Unlike models that\\nprimarily scale with size, Phi-4 follows a distinct training approach, making it important to\\ncompare against other LLMs. Its relatively small size also makes it relevant for low-resource\\nenvironments, where optimizing data efficiency can be a crucial factor in model deployment.\\nThe Qwen model family, developed by Alibaba Cloud, includes general-purpose [45] and\\ncode-specialized [46] LLMs over a wide range of sizes. Their scalability, architectural opti-\\nmizations, and strong reasoning capabilities make them valuable for benchmarking efficiency\\nand specialization. Here, the most recent 2.5 versions are tested—namely the specialized coder\\nimplementations (0.5B, 1.5B, and 3B) and the general-purpose 0.5B model—as well as QwQ\\n(Qwen with Questions) 32B model with advanced reasoning capabilities.\\n3.4. Implementation\\nThe pipeline for submitting a prompt to an LLM, obtaining a response, extracting a Python\\nfunction, and executing it is illustrated in Figure 1. The process begins by iterating through\\na predefined set of LLMs, seeds, temperatures, and prompts. Each prompt is submitted to\\nthe corresponding LLM, and its response is stored in a text file. Next, the function from each\\nstored response is extracted by searching for the function definition (e.g., ‘def requested_-\\nfunction():’) and capturing all internal code up to the last properly indented ‘return’ state-\\nment. This ensures that functions defined within the external function do not prematurely\\n9\\nAsk LLM\\nQwen\\nDeepSeek\\nGemma\\nMistral\\nPhi\\nGPT\\nLlama\\nTemperature\\nSeed\\nPre-Processing\\nanswer.txt\\nPrompt\\nfunction.py\\nRun Python Code\\nreturn value\\nCompare Results\\nScenario_values.json\\nresults.csv\\nInput Data\\nOutput Data\\nProcessing\\nSuccess?\\nYes\\nYes\\nNo\\nNo\\nPossible result: 0\\xa0\\nPossible result: 1, 2\\xa0\\nPossible result:\\xa0\\n3, 4, 5\\xa0\\nFunction Name\\nFunction Parameters\\nFunction Result\\nSuccess?\\nFigure 1: Validation pipeline for the results of LLMs under study.\\nterminate the extraction. The extracted function is then recorded in a Python file for execu-\\ntion. If the function is not successfully extracted—such as when the defined function name\\ndoes not match the expected one—this information is logged in the results file, and a score of\\nzero is assigned for that LLM, seed, temperature, and prompt combination.\\nIf the Python function is correctly generated and extracted, it is tested under Python 3.9.6\\nusing the data provided for each scenario (presented in Section 3.5). One of three possible\\noutcomes may occur:\\n• The code contains a syntax error and does not compile, in which case a score of 1 is\\nrecorded in the results file;\\n• The code executes but encounters a runtime error, resulting in an exception, in which\\ncase a score of 2 is stored in the results file;\\n• The code executes successfully and returns a result, in which case the score ranges from\\n3 to 5, as detailed below.\\nIf the code executes successfully, the function’s output is evaluated as follows: if the returned\\nvalue is of a different type than expected (e.g., a float instead of an int), a score of 3 is recorded\\nin the results file. This type check is performed broadly; for example, if an integer is expected,\\ntypes such as int, np.int32, or np.int64 are considered valid (where np refers to the NumPy\\nlibrary). If the type is correct, the next step is to verify whether the returned value matches\\n10\\nthe expected value. For floating-point comparisons, a tolerance of 1% is allowed. If the result\\nis incorrect, a score of 4 is assigned. Finally, if the returned value is correct, a score of 5 is\\nrecorded, indicating 100% functionally correct code. At the end of this process, a file containing\\nall recorded scores is available for analysis.\\nIn summary, scores between 0 and 5 are characterized as follows:\\n0. No Python file was generated—This indicates that the LLM did not generate a Python\\nfunction or that the generated function does not have the name specified in the prompt.\\n1. Syntax error—The code does not compile.\\n2. Runtime error—The code is valid Python but has logic incongruencies and/or does not\\nconform to the prompt requirements.\\n3. Code runs but returns an incorrect data type—For Prompts 1 and 2, it should return an\\ninteger (the index value), while in Prompt 3, it should return a float.\\n4. Code runs but returns an incorrect result.\\n5. Code runs and returns the correct result.\\n3.5. Experimental Setup\\nTo thoroughly test the capabilities of the models listed in Section 3.3, the prompts presented\\nin Section 3.2 were individually submitted to LLMs using six different pseudo-random number\\ngenerator seeds across six temperature values, in a total of 36 submissions per prompt for each\\nLLM. Temperatures were increased in 0.2 increments from 0.0 to 1.0 for locally executed LLMs\\nvia Ollama. Although Ollama accepts temperatures in the range of 0.0–1.0, both DeepSeek-V3\\nand GPT-4, executed through their online APIs, accept temperatures in the 0.0–2.0 range.\\nTherefore, temperatures were doubled for these models. For example, and for the purpose of\\nthis study, a temperature of 0.6 in local models is doubled to 1.2 when submitting a prompt to\\nonline LLMs.\\nThe LLM-generated Python functions were tested with the following input data, and return\\nvalues for each prompt were expected:\\nPrompt 1 The input data are an array of four positions, namely [(2, 5), (7, 7), (1, 8), (1, 0.5)].\\nThe expected return value is 3, corresponding to coordinate (1, 0.5), which is the closest\\none to the BS, which is fixed at (0, 0).\\nPrompt 2 The input data are an array containing the following coordinates:\\nBS / UAV\\n→\\n(38.759297963817374, −9.154483012234662)\\nPosition 1\\n→\\n(38.749330295687805, −9.15304293547367)\\nPosition 2\\n→\\n(38.75727072916799, −9.157797377555926)\\nPosition 3\\n→\\n(38.737648166512336, −9.138660615310467)\\nPosition 4\\n→\\n(38.76841010033327, −9.160013961052972)\\nThe expected return value is 2, corresponding to the index of Position 2, which minimizes\\nthe power loss.\\nPrompt 3 The input data are the same as in Prompt 2, but the expected value is −50.33\\ndBm, which is the minimal loss, obtained at Position 2.\\n11\\nAs described in Section 3.4, the capabilities of the different LLMs in correctly answer-\\ning Prompts 1–3 are assessed using a score between 0 and 5. For six submissions (one per\\nseed) for each prompt–model–temperature combination, four summary statistics are calculated\\nand presented: the mean score, a non-parametric 95% confidence interval around the mean,\\nthe percentage of perfect scores (score equal to 5), and a histogram of score distribution. These\\nmetrics allow for a detailed performance investigation of the capabilities of the 16 tested models\\nto generate Python code to solve the three progressively complex LoRaWAN-related prompts.\\nIn addition to these summary statistics, a formal statistical comparison between models\\nis conducted using stratified permutation tests [47]. To account for varying prompt difficulty,\\nmodel performance is stratified by prompt, allowing all three prompts to be included in a unified\\ntesting procedure. For each pairwise comparison between two models at a given temperature,\\nscores are pooled by prompt (six scores per model per prompt, 12 in total), and a one-sided\\npermutation test is applied.\\nThe test statistic is the sum of mean rank differences across\\nprompts. All\\n\\x0012\\n6\\n\\x01\\n= 924 possible permutations of model labels are precomputed per prompt,\\nand 1000 stratified permutations are generated by randomly selecting one permutation per\\nprompt and combining them. The resulting null distribution is used to estimate the probability\\nof obtaining a test statistic as large or larger than the observed one under the null hypothesis\\nof no difference. The tests are one-sided, since the goal is to determine whether one model\\nsignificantly outperforms another—not whether it is worse. Finally, multiple testing correction\\nis applied using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure to control the false discovery rate (FDR)\\nacross all comparisons [48].\\n4. Results\\nResults for the simpler Prompt 1 are shown in Figure 2 and Table 3. While all models\\ngenerated accurate code for certain seed/temperature combinations, DeepSeek-V3 and Phi-4\\nstood out, consistently providing correct answers across all seeds and temperatures. The three\\nLLaMA models, the three Qwen coder models, and GPT-4 also demonstrated strong perfor-\\nmance, reliably generating correct code for at least a subset of temperature values—typically\\nat lower settings. Interestingly, GPT-4 exhibited a significant drop in answer quality at tem-\\nperatures of 1.6 and higher (i.e., 2 × 0.8), with responses becoming essentially random at the\\nhighest temperature. In contrast, the DeepSeek-R1 models (7B and 70B), the Gemma models\\n(2B), the Mistral model (7B), and the non-coder Qwen models (2.5-0.5B and QwQ-32B) failed\\nto consistently produce correct answers.\\nResults for the slightly more complex Prompt 2, for which the UAV position is given as\\na function argument (i.e., it is not predefined within the function) and actual geographical\\ncoordinates are used, are shown in Figure 3 and Table 4. Only four models consistently gener-\\nated accurate code: the larger online DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4 models, as well as the smaller,\\nlocally tested LLaMA-3.3 and Phi-4. However, the drop in performance for GPT-4 at higher\\ntemperatures is even more pronounced for this prompt. Conversely, Gemma (2B), Mistral (7B),\\nand both 0.5B Qwen models failed to produce a single correct answer.\\n12\\ncodellama:7b\\ndeepseek-r1:70b\\ndeepseek-r1:7b\\ndeepseek-v3\\ngemma2:2b\\ngemma:2b\\ngpt-4-0613\\nllama3.2:3b\\nllama3.3:70b\\nmistral:7b\\nphi4:14b\\nqwen2.5-coder:0.5b\\nqwen2.5-coder:1.5b\\nqwen2.5-coder:3b\\nqwen2.5:0.5b\\nqwq:32b\\nModel\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\nScore\\nTemp.\\n0.0\\n0.2\\n0.4\\n0.6\\n0.8\\n1.0\\nFigure 2: Prompt 1 mean answer score for the tested models over several temperatures.

This distinction arguably makes it the most complex task for the models evaluated in\\nthis study. The results for this prompt are presented in Figure 4 and Table 5. The same four\\nmodels continued to generate accurate code consistently, though within a more limited range\\nof temperature settings. DeepSeek-V3 demonstrated the highest overall consistency, reliably\\nproducing correct code at temperatures of 0.8 (2 × 0.4) and 1.2 (2 × 0.6), while maintaining\\na high percentage of accurate responses across the remaining temperatures. GPT-4 and Phi-4\\nachieved 100% accuracy when the temperature was set to zero. However, while Phi-4 remained\\nhighly consistent at higher temperatures, GPT-4 exhibited a significant decline in performance.\\nLLaMA-3.3 also demonstrated strong consistency, achieving 100% accuracy in all runs at tem-\\nperatures of 0.2 and 0.4. None of the remaining models were able to successfully complete this\\ntask. The only exception was Qwen’s QwQ (32B), which generated a single correct response at\\na temperature of 0.6. However, beyond this isolated instance, it predominantly produced code\\ncontaining invalid syntax or runtime errors.\\nFigure 5 presents a pairwise significance heatmap based on p-values from a stratified permu-\\ntation test, after FDR multiple testing correction, indicating which models (in rows) statisti-\\ncally outperformed others (in columns) across temperatures. Table 6 summarizes these results,\\nshowing the number of models each system significantly outperformed at each temperature,\\nas well as the overall total across all temperatures. These results reinforce what was observed\\nin the descriptive statistics—namely that DeepSeek-V3, GPT-4, Phi-4, and LLaMA-3.3 are the\\nmost consistent and competitive models in these engineering tasks. At nearly all temperature\\nlevels, these models significantly outperformed the majority of alternatives, with corrected p-\\nvalues below the 0.05 threshold in a substantial number of pairwise comparisons. In particular,\\nDeepSeek-V3, Phi-4, and LLaMA-3.3 achieved the highest number of significant wins at ev-\\nery temperature, while GPT-4 showed similarly strong performance at lower temperatures but\\nexhibited a sharp decline in statistical superiority as temperature increased.\\nIn contrast, the two DeepSeek-R1 models, as well as QwQ, registered very few significant\\nwins at any temperature. Crucially, their only advantages were against GPT-4 at higher tem-\\nperatures, where its output becomes increasingly random and unsuitable for these types of\\ncoding tasks. This further confirms their limited effectiveness, as already observed in previous\\nresults. An additional insight—less apparent in the descriptive statistics but clearly highlighted\\nin Table 6—is the lack of correlation between model size and performance within the Qwen\\ncoder family. Specifically, the 1.5B Qwen coder model achieved the fourth highest total number\\nof pairwise wins (47), surpassing even GPT-4 (45), while the larger 3B variant achieved roughly\\nhalf as many.\\nFinally, Figure 6 presents the mean scores for the tested models across all three prompts,\\naggregating results from all seeds and temperature settings. While the initial assumption was\\nthat Prompts 1 to 3 increase in complexity, and the results thus far appear to support this hy-\\npothesis, Figure 6 provides a more comprehensive perspective. For most models, the mean score\\ndeclines progressively with increasing prompt complexity, reinforcing this assumption. How-\\never, exceptions include both Gemma models and the non-coder Qwen-2.5 model, where the\\nscore reduction is not strictly monotonic. Another observation from this figure is that the high-\\nest performing models—DeepSeek-V3, GPT-4, LLaMA-3.3, and Phi-4—maintain consistent\\nperformance across prompts, with only a slight decline in mean score as complexity increases.\\n16\\ncodellama:7b\\ndeepseek-r1:70b\\ndeepseek-r1:7b\\ndeepseek-v3\\ngemma2:2b\\ngemma:2b\\ngpt-4-0613\\nllama3.2:3b\\nllama3.3:70b\\nmistral:7b\\nphi4:14b\\nqwen2.5-coder:0.5b\\nqwen2.5-coder:1.5b\\nqwen2.5-coder:3b\\nqwen2.5:0.5b\\nqwq:32b\\ncodellama:7b\\ndeepseek-r1:70b\\ndeepseek-r1:7b\\ndeepseek-v3\\ngemma2:2b\\ngemma:2b\\ngpt-4-0613\\nllama3.2:3b\\nllama3.3:70b\\nmistral:7b\\nphi4:14b\\nqwen2.5-coder:0.5b\\nqwen2.5-coder:1.5b\\nqwen2.5-coder:3b\\nqwen2.5:0.5b\\nqwq:32b\\ncodellama:7b\\ndeepseek-r1:70b\\ndeepseek-r1:7b\\ndeepseek-v3\\ngemma2:2b\\ngemma:2b\\ngpt-4-0613\\nllama3.2:3b\\nllama3.3:70b\\nmistral:7b\\nphi4:14b\\nqwen2.5-coder:0.5b\\nqwen2.5-coder:1.5b\\nqwen2.5-coder:3b\\nqwen2.5:0.5b\\nqwq:32b\\ncodellama:7b\\ndeepseek-r1:70b\\ndeepseek-r1:7b\\ndeepseek-v3\\ngemma2:2b\\ngemma:2b\\ngpt-4-0613\\nllama3.2:3b\\nllama3.3:70b\\nmistral:7b\\nphi4:14b\\nqwen2.5-coder:0.5b\\nqwen2.5-coder:1.5b\\nqwen2.5-coder:3b\\nqwen2.5:0.5b\\nqwq:32b\\ncodellama:7b\\ndeepseek-r1:70b\\ndeepseek-r1:7b\\ndeepseek-v3\\ngemma2:2b\\ngemma:2b\\ngpt-4-0613\\nllama3.2:3b\\nllama3.3:70b\\nmistral:7b\\nphi4:14b\\nqwen2.5-coder:0.5b\\nqwen2.5-coder:1.5b\\nqwen2.5-coder:3b\\nqwen2.5:0.5b\\nqwq:32b\\nTemp = 0.0\\nTemp = 0.2\\nTemp = 0.4\\nTemp = 0.6\\nTemp = 0.8\\nTemp = 1.0\\np < 0.01\\np < 0.05\\nNot signiﬁcant\\nFigure 5: Pairwise significance heatmap of model performance comparisons for the three prompts across tem-\\nperatures.\\nEach colored block represents the p-value of a one-sided, rank-based stratified permutation test\\nbetween two models (model in row vs. model in column) for a given temperature.

Discussion\\nWithin the DeepSeek model family, there was a surprising discrepancy between the well-\\nperforming DeepSeek-V3 and the underperforming DeepSeek-R1 models. The DeepSeek-R1\\nversions (7B and 70B), despite their larger parameter counts, rarely generated correct code.\\nInterestingly, the DeepSeek-R1 models, as well as Qwen’s QwQ (32B), tended to generate\\nanswers over five times longer than those from other models, yet without improved correctness.\\nWhile these verbose outputs are particularly noticeable, we did not investigate the reasons\\nbehind them because this lies beyond the scope of this study. Nonetheless, the generated data—\\nas well as further analyses on this matter—are available on Zenodo1 and may be addressed in\\nfuture studies.\\nAn important observation is that GPT-4 exhibits essentially random outputs when oper-\\nating at higher temperatures. This behavior aligns with OpenAI’s own documentation, which\\nindicates that temperatures above 1.2 or 1.4 may lead to increasingly stochastic completions.\\nIn contrast, the other top-performing models in this study—DeepSeek-V3, LLaMA-3.3, and Phi-\\n4—remain relatively robust under higher temperature settings. These considerations indicate\\nthat temperature influences each model differently. Differences in temperature scaling ranges\\n(0–1 vs. 0–2) further complicate direct comparisons.\\nAlthough one might expect a clear correlation between model size and code generation\\nquality, results support a more involved situation among locally run models. Larger models\\nsuch as DeepSeek-R1 (70B) and QwQ (32B) do not necessarily outperform smaller alternatives:\\ntheir answers were typically long yet largely incorrect. Conversely, some mid- to large-scale\\nmodels, such as Phi-4 (14B) and LLaMA-3.3 (70B), consistently provided accurate solutions to\\nall prompts. Another example, LLaMA-3.2 (3B), showed reasonable performance for simpler\\ntasks but struggled with more complex prompts, highlighting a lower boundary for parameter\\ncount beyond which performance degrades. In contrast, Qwen’s smaller coder models (0.5B,\\n1.5B, 3B) did not show any clear advantage with increasing size, confirming that raw parameter\\ncounts alone are insufficient to predict success across different tasks.\\nWithin the Gemini-based lineage, Gemma-2 offered marginal improvements over its older\\nv1.1 sibling, though neither model consistently produced correct outputs. On the other hand,\\nLLaMA-3.3 (70B) clearly outperformed the related LLaMA-3.2 (3B), a result likely driven by\\nits substantially larger parameter count. Phi-4 merits special mention for delivering accurate\\ncode across all tasks, seeds, and temperatures, while requiring considerably fewer parameters\\n(14B) than the largest competitors. This affords Phi-4 a strong performance/size ratio among\\nthe locally executed models.\\nTo support these observations, a stratified permutation test with FDR correction was applied\\nacross all model pairs and temperatures. The resulting significance heatmap and win counts\\nshowed strong agreement with the descriptive statistics. DeepSeek-V3, Phi-4, and LLaMA-\\n3.3 consistently achieved the highest number of statistically significant wins, while GPT-4 also\\ndominated at lower temperatures. These results reinforce that the observed differences in model\\nperformance are statistically meaningful and not artifacts of randomness or scoring variability.\\nFrom a broader perspective, these findings support the notion that carefully tuned, locally\\nrun models can achieve near-state-of-the-art performance in specialized Python code generation\\ntasks without necessarily relying on proprietary solutions. Specifically, both Phi-4 and LLaMA-\\n3.3 proved capable of reliably generating correct solutions for the type of UAV/LoRaWAN\\nplanning prompts tested in this work. Their consistency in providing accurate answers un-\\nder varying seeds and temperature conditions places them among the top-performing models\\n1https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14888673\\n19\\noverall, comparable to GPT-4 and DeepSeek-V3. These results address the central research\\nquestion: lightweight and locally executed LLMs can, in fact, generate correct Python code for\\nrelatively simple LoRaWAN and UAV planning tasks, provided that their parameter counts\\nand training procedures meet a certain threshold of quality and scale. The performance of\\nPhi-4 was particularly impressive, especially considering it is a relatively lightweight model.\\n6. Limitations\\nDespite the insights gained from this study, several limitations should be acknowledged.\\nFirst, the selection of models, while diverse, was not exhaustive. Only a subset of locally run\\nlightweight models was evaluated, and online testing was limited to GPT-4 and DeepSeek-V3.\\nSeveral potentially relevant models, such as Claude, Mistral (larger online versions), and spe-\\ncialized coding models (e.g., Gemma Coder or DeepSeek Coder), were not included.\\nThis\\nrestricted scope leaves open the possibility that other models may perform competitively or\\neven outperform those tested in this study.\\nSecond, model outputs were assessed solely based on functional correctness, without a de-\\ntailed qualitative analysis of the responses. This introduces the risk that some answers classified\\nas correct may not have been genuinely derived but instead relied on unintended memoriza-\\ntion, dataset leakage, or other forms of ‘cheating’. While this concern is most relevant for\\nPrompts 1 and 2, where only an index is returned, Prompt 3 mitigates this issue by requiring\\na real-valued output. Nevertheless, a more rigorous analysis of response quality—including\\npotential hallucinations, redundant reasoning, and incorrect assumptions—would strengthen\\nfuture work.\\nThird, the study relied on a single test case per function, which limits the robustness of\\ncorrectness assessments. A more comprehensive evaluation would include multiple test cases\\nper function, ensuring that responses generalize beyond a specific input scenario. This is par-\\nticularly relevant given the stochastic nature of LLM-generated code, where seemingly minor\\nvariations in the prompt or execution conditions can lead to significant changes in output va-\\nlidity.\\nFourth, all evaluations were conducted using zero-shot natural language prompts, with-\\nout fine-tuning or explicit prompt engineering. While this choice aligns with practical use cases\\nwhere domain experts may rely on straightforward instructions, further experimentation with\\nprompt optimization strategies—such as chain-of-thought prompting or few-shot learning—\\ncould provide deeper insights into model capabilities.\\nAdditionally, the study focused on relatively simple UAV/LoRaWAN planning tasks. While\\nthese scenarios are relevant to real-world applications, they do not necessarily capture the\\nfull complexity of autonomous UAV coordination, network interference, or real-time decision-\\nmaking in dynamic environments. The strong performance of top models suggests they may be\\ncapable of handling more complex scenarios, but this remains an open question for future re-\\nsearch.\\nA final limitation concerns the use of statistical significance testing. While stratified per-\\nmutation tests confirmed the robustness of performance differences, they do not account for the\\nmagnitude or practical implications of those differences. Moreover, the use of discrete, ordinal\\nscores simplifies model outputs and may obscure subtle qualitative distinctions. Although mul-\\ntiple testing correction was applied to reduce false positives, this also reduces sensitivity to\\nborderline effects. Additionally, comparisons at non-zero temperatures should be interpreted\\nwith caution, as temperature scaling is handled differently across models, potentially resulting\\nin varying degrees of output randomness for the same nominal value. These tests therefore\\ncomplement, but do not replace, the broader descriptive analysis presented earlier.\\n20\\nThese limitations do not diminish the validity of the study’s conclusions but highlight areas\\nfor refinement in subsequent investigations. A broader model selection, more rigorous evaluation\\nmetrics, and extended task complexity would further improve the understanding of LLMs’\\ncapabilities in UAV and LoRaWAN-related computational tasks.\\n7. Conclusions\\nThis paper analyzed the capabilities of 16 LLMs to generate Python functions for prac-\\ntical LoRaWAN-related engineering tasks involving UAV placement and signal propagation.\\nBy progressively increasing the complexity of prompts, we evaluated each model’s ability to\\nreturn valid and correct solutions under a standardized scoring system.\\nThe findings indi-\\ncate that several recent models—particularly DeepSeek-V3, GPT-4, LLaMA-3.3, and Phi-4—\\nconsistently generated accurate and executable functions.\\nParticularly, Phi-4 displayed ex-\\nceptional performance despite its relatively lightweight architecture, demonstrating that well-\\noptimized, smaller-scale models can be highly effective for specialized engineering applications.\\nModels that did not achieve high scores often struggled with prompt interpretation, code syn-\\ntax, or domain-specific computations, underlining the need for careful prompt engineering and\\nmodel fine-tuning in similar applications.\\nThe demonstrated viability of lightweight and locally executed LLMs for specialized engi-\\nneering tasks such as UAV planning in LoRaWAN environments suggests that these models\\ncould significantly lower computational barriers and costs, allowing for broader and more flex-\\nible integration of AI-driven code generation into practical engineering workflows.\\nWhile this study highlighted the strong potential of LLMs in engineering workflows, cer-\\ntain limitations must be acknowledged, including the constrained model selection, the single\\ntest case per function, and the absence of qualitative analysis of responses. However, these\\nlimitations present opportunities for future research. Expanding test sets, incorporating more\\ncomplex domain requirements, and evaluating additional models—particularly other lightweight\\nalternatives—could further enrich our understanding of LLM-driven code generation in wireless\\ncommunications and related fields. Future research could also explore the incorporation of re-\\ninforcement learning with human feedback to further improve the code generation capabilities\\nof lightweight LLMs [49].\\nData Availability\\nThe data generated by this study and its respective analysis are available at https://doi.\\norg/10.5281/zenodo.14888673 under the CC-BY license.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThis research was partially funded by: Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT, https:\\n//ror.org/00snfqn58) under Grants Copelabs ref.
